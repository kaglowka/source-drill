          "To determine whether the group differences reported above<br>were due to differences in other substance use or factors<br>that could predate marijuana use , secondary analyses using<br>ANCOVAs separately ( due to limited power ) controlled for<br>lifetime alcohol consumption , days since last drink ,<br>drinks per month , years of regular drinking , time since<br>last cigarette , past week cigarettes per smoking day ,<br>cigarettes per month , FTND total , number of lifetime other<br>drug use episodes , family history of substance use<br>disorders , family history of psychiatric disorders , each<br>NEO -FFI score , and BDI total .",
          "For all analyses , groups continued to differ on BOLD<br>response in all clusters ( p range , 0.001 to 0.0001 ) .To<br>determine whether differences between groups were due to<br>duration and intensity of exposure to THC or related to the<br>recency of marijuana use , we conducted a series of<br>exploratory regression analyses among MJ users ( n=16 ) .",
          "Duration of regular marijuana use was negatively related to<br>no -go brain response in the right anterior superior frontal<br>gyrus ( BA 10 ; β=−0.73 , p<0.001 ; plotted in Fig . 2 ) ,<br>right superior middle frontal gyrus ( BA 6 ; β=−0.58 ,<br>p<0.025 ) , and left anterior superior frontal gyrus ( BA 10<br>; β=−0.58 , p < 0.025 ) , suggesting that youth with longer<br>durations of marijuana involvement had less no -go brain<br>response .",
          "Similarly , early age of onset of regular marijuana use ( β<br>= 0.66 , p<0.01 ) and more lifetime marijuana use episodes (<br>β=−.62 , p<0.025 ) related to less inhibitory response in<br>the right anterior superior frontal gyrus ( BA 10 ) .",

          "Days since last marijuana use ( range , 28 to 240 ) , age ,<br>and neuropsychological test performance were not associated<br>with brain response in any region demonstrating a group<br>difference .",
          "Number of lifetime other drug use episodes ( primarily pain<br>medications ) was positively associated with BOLD response<br>contrast to no -go trials in the right anterior superior<br>frontal gyrus ( BA 10 ; β=0.57 , p < 0.025 ) and right<br>middle frontal gyrus ( BA 6 , β=0.56 , p < 0.025 ) .",
          "In this study , marijuana -using adolescents showed<br>increased BOLD response during both inhibitory and non<br>-inhibitory trials of a go/no -go task , even after a 28<br>-day washout period of abstinence from cannabis , as<br>compared to control adolescents with limited substance use<br>histories .",
          "Differences were prominent in dorsolateral prefrontal and<br>parietal areas .",
          "Our findings with adolescent marijuana users extend those of<br>others ( Gruber and Yurgelun -Todd 2005 ) , who Fig . 1<br>Inhibition trial differences in BOLD response contrast<br>between marijuana -using ( n=16 ) and non -using ( n=17 )<br>adolescents after 28 days of monitored abstinence .",
          "Blue areas show where users had more significantly BOLD<br>response during inhibition ( no -go ) trials relative to<br>baseline than non -users ( p<0.05 , clusters > 943 μl ) ; no<br>clusters in which users showed significantly less activation<br>than controls were found ( see Table 2 ) showed that adult<br>marijuana users exhibited increased prefrontal response<br>during inhibition tasks .",
          "The present results thus suggest that the effects of<br>cannabis use on brain function in adolescents may persist<br>after a period of abstinence .",
          "A pattern of increased activation yet comparable performance<br>is consistent with functional compensation and<br>dedifferentiation ( Rajah and D 'Esposito 2005 ) , which<br>supposes that loci of functional activity are spread to more<br>and larger regions .",
          "Therefore , adolescent marijuana users appear to recruit<br>more neural tissue in executive control areas to adequately<br>perform the task , which is consistent with other studies<br>showing increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation in MJ<br>users during inhibition ( Gruber and Yurgelun -Todd 2005 )<br>and other ( Schweinsburg et al . 2005b ) cognitive tasks .",
          "Repeated cannabinoid use may alter neuromaturation in<br>regions with high CB1 densities , such as prefrontal cortex<br>( Eggan and Lewis 2007 ) .",
          "Synaptic pruning and gray matter sculpting occurs late in<br>some of the regions showing increased BOLD signal among<br>users , such as bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ,<br>where cortical thickness peaks at age 11.5 on average (<br>Gogtay et al . 2004 ; Sowell et al . 2003 ) .",
          "If prefrontal synaptic pruning is slowed by adolescent<br>marijuana use , greater activation may reflect excess neural<br>firing caused by a larger number of synaptic links .",
          "In their study of heavy marijuana -using adults , Gruber and<br>Yurgelun -Todd ( 2005 ) reported that heavy users had<br>increased prefrontal response to an inhibition task , as<br>seen in this study of adolescents , but also showed reduced<br>anterior cingulate response , which we did not observe in<br>this study .",
          "One possible explanation for this difference is the duration<br>of marijuana use in our cohort .",
          "It may take a longer period of use to evidence such changes<br>in cingulate responding .",
          "The increased parietal activation among marijuana -using<br>adolescents is consistent with findings from Jacobsen et al<br>. ( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .",
          "As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .",
          "Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .",
          "Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .",
          "Similarly , Chang et al . ( 2006 ) reported that adults who<br>started marijuana use in late adolescence had more frontal<br>activation during a visual attention task than adults who<br>started in early adolescence .",
          "Although our data do not address the molecular mechanism of<br>this difference , we can speculate about the nature of this<br>finding .",
          "For example , increased prefrontal activation during an<br>inhibitory task in adolescent users with a more recent onset<br>may reflect a stage of neural and behavioral compensation .",
          "This compensatory response may occur within the first few<br>years of regular adolescent marijuana use and may later be<br>followed by neuroadaptation or other processes , possibly<br>related to downregulation of cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors .",
          "Therefore , an inverted U -shaped response pattern may<br>emerge over time , which eventually results in brain<br>activation patterns that are indistinguishable from non<br>-users ( suggested in Fig . 2 ) . BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .",
          "Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased cerebral blood flow ( Mathew et al . 2002 ) and<br>volume ( Sneider et al . 2006 ) in frontal , insular ,<br>anterior cingulate , cerebellum , temporal , and paralimbic<br>regions ; reductions in auditory and visual cortex ,<br>parietal lobe , and thalamus ; and no change in nucleus<br>accumbens , basal ganglia , or the hippocampus ( O 'Leary et<br>al . 2002 ) .",
          "Although increases in blood flow velocity and<br>cerebrovascular resistance dissipate from 3 to 28 days of<br>abstinence in adults with marijuana use levels consistent<br>with this sample ( i.e . , 15.9 days per month ) , very<br>heavy users remained abnormally elevated ( Herning et al .<br>2005 ) .",
          "Thus , increased BOLD response in adolescent marijuana users<br>could reflect residual cerebrovasculature abnormalities ,<br>although increased blood flow or volume would likely yield<br>lower BOLD response ( Brown et al . 2003 ) , not greater ,<br>as seen here .",
          "This study had several limitations .",
          "While groups were equivalent on many demographic variables ,<br>intelligence , Fig . 2 Marijuana using adolescents ( n=16 )<br>show more BOLD response ( y -axis displays fit coefficients<br>) during inhibition trials relative to baseline than control<br>adolescents ( n=17 ) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex<br>, largely accounted for by users with 1 to 3 years of<br>regular ( weekly ) marijuana use and task performance ,<br>marijuana users had greater alcohol and other substance<br>histories and a trend for more depressed symptomatology .",
          "Although activation patterns remained after controlling for<br>these factors , substance and affective differences pose the<br>possibility of synergistic effects , and we have previously<br>found adolescent heavy drinking to be related to abnormal<br>activation patterns on a spatial working memory task",

          "Tapert et al . 2001 Tapert et al . , 2004 .",
          "Reduced educational engagement or altered sleep quality<br>related to marijuana use might account for the differences .",
          "Critically , the current data cannot ascertain if marijuana<br>use during adolescence produces the observed differences or<br>if abnormalities existed before the onset of regular use .",
          "Groups did not differ on proportion with a family history of<br>substance use disorder , and youths with psychiatric<br>diagnosis ( e.g . , conduct disorder , attention<br>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ) were excluded from the<br>study .",
          "Groups were similar with regard to most personality and<br>psychopathological syndrome dimensions but did differ on<br>openness to new experiences and parent report of delinquent<br>behaviors , which also may predate or result from adolescent<br>marijuana use , but did not account for group differences in<br>brain response .",
          "On the other hand , the adolescents who diverged most from<br>normal controls may simply differ on unmeasured risk factors<br>related to the initiation and escalation of substance use .",

          "Demands for inhibitory control increases substantially over<br>the course of late adolescence , particularly in school and<br>work environments as well as social and intimate<br>relationships .",
          "Consequently , youth required to exert extra neurocognitive<br>effort may be disadvantaged or become less successful in<br>maneuvering the normal transitions of adolescence and young<br>adulthood .",
          "Additionally , it may be harder for these youth to inhibit<br>the use of substances , particularly in situations where<br>cognitive demands are strained due to conflicting goals ,<br>distractions , peers , substance -relevant cues , or low<br>mood states ."

          "Adolescence is also a period of continued neurodevelopment ,<br>including frontal lobe myelination and synaptic pruning that<br>subserve improved executive functioning ( Gogtay et al .<br>2004 ; Sowell et al . 2002 ) , including abilities such as<br>decision making , inhibitory processing , and impulse<br>control .",
          "The influence of marijuana use on these maturational<br>processes is unknown , although executive dysfunction may<br>affect the development and maintenance of substance use and<br>problems during adolescence ( Tapert et al . 2002a ) .",
          "Adults with heavy marijuana use histories have demonstrated<br>abnormalities in executive functioning ( Fletcher et al .<br>1996 ; Pope and Yurgelun Todd 1996 ; Solowij et al . 2002 )<br>and indices of frontal lobe operation ( Block et al . 2000 ;<br>Kanayama et al . 2004 ; Lundqvist et al . 2001 ; Solowij et<br>al . 1991 Solowij et al . , 1995 Struve et al . 1998 ) .",
          "To determine if cognitive deficits in marijuana users are<br>transient or persistent , Pope et al . ( 2001 ) tested 63<br>current marijuana users ( > 5,000 lifetime uses ) , 45<br>former users ( > 5,000 lifetime uses ) , and 72 normal<br>controls ( 1-50 lifetime uses ) , all ages 30-55 .",
          "Participants were abstinent for 28 days , verified by urine<br>drug screens and given neuropsychological tests on days 0 ,<br>1 , 7 , and 28 of abstinence .",
          "Current users showed some deficits relative to controls on<br>days 0 , 1 , and 7 , but groups did not differ on any test<br>by day 28 .",
          "In contrast , a study ( Bolla et al . 2002 ) that<br>hospitalized 22 marijuana -using adults ( > 2 years of<br>marijuana use ) for 28 days to assure abstinence found<br>greater marijuana intake linked to poorer performance on<br>tests of inhibition , problem solving , learning , and<br>reaction time .",
          "Disinhibition , i.e . , the impaired ability to inhibit a<br>potentially inappropriate response , is a common feature of<br>substance misuse ( Chen et al . 2007 ; Kamarajan et al .<br>2006 ; Kirisci et al . 2006 ; Verdejo -Garcia et al . 2006 )<br>.",
          "Neuroimaging studies have reported both prefrontal and<br>posterior parietal cortical involvement during inhibitory<br>processing in healthy volunteers ( Liu et al . 2004 ) ,<br>which may be overactive in populations with impulse control<br>problems ( Schulz et al . 2004 ) .",
          "Few studies have examined inhibitory processing in marijuana<br>users .",
          "Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( f MRI )<br>characterized the neural correlates of inhibition during a<br>Stroop task , in which heavy marijuana -using adults and non<br>-users were asked to inhibit the automatic process of<br>reading words and , instead , name the colors of words<br>printed in incongruent ink ( Gruber and Yurgelun Todd 2005 )<br>.",
          "Marijuana users not only showed greater midcingulate and<br>reduced anterior cingulate blood oxygen level dependent (<br>BOLD ) response but also more widespread bilateral<br>dorsolateral prefrontal activation during inhibition<br>relative to color naming trials .",
          "The investigators speculated that the altered activation<br>pattern in marijuana users reflects compensation and use of<br>alternate strategies .",
          "The same investigators had shown in a previous f MRI study<br>using a working memory task before and after a 28 -day<br>abstinence period ( Yurgelun -Todd et al . 1998 ) that adult<br>users demonstrated less prefrontal and more anterior<br>cingulate response than controls after just 24 h of non -use<br>.",
          "Although users showed some normalization of prefrontal<br>functioning after 28 days of abstinence , they still showed<br>anterior cingulate dysfunction , which is supportive of<br>persisting neural processing abnormalities .",
          "These results support the hypothesis that adult marijuana<br>users show abnormal neural inhibitory processing ,<br>compensatory hyper -activity , and altered neural processing<br>differences in the absence of the intoxicating agent .",
          "Few studies have examined neurocognitive effects of<br>marijuana use among adolescents , but some reports<br>identified decrements in attention ( Tapert et al . 2002b )<br>, and learning and memory ( Millsaps et al . 1994 ; Schwartz<br>et al . 1989 ) associated with early marijuana use .",
          "We previously demonstrated increased dorsolateral prefrontal<br>and decreased inferior frontal f MRI response during a<br>spatial working memory task among teens with comorbid<br>alcohol and marijuana use disorders compared to those with<br>alcohol use disorders alone and to non -using controls ,<br>suggesting a marijuana use -related increase in dorsolateral<br>prefrontal effort ( Schweinsburg et al . 2005b ) .",
          "However , most studies of adolescent marijuana users were<br>conducted after several days of abstinence , so effects<br>could be transitory .",
          "Jacobsen et al . ( 2004 ) addressed this concern by<br>evaluating seven adolescent marijuana users , seven<br>demographically similar tobacco smokers , and seven non<br>-users with a working memory task during f MRI acquisition<br>after about a month of abstinence .",
          "Marijuana users were less accurate on the task and showed<br>increased BOLD response in the right hippocampus relative to<br>other groups .",
          "The authors suggested that marijuana users might have failed<br>to inhibit hippocampal activity during the task , perhaps<br>due to cannabis -induced changes in inhibitory<br>neurotransmission or apoptosis in the hippocampus .",
          "These researchers then compared 15 adolescents with and 18<br>without histories of cannabis use during nicotine withdrawal<br>.",
          "Cannabis users , but not non -users , showed nicotine<br>withdrawal -precipitated increases in parietal activation<br>and disruptions in frontoparietal connectivity during a<br>verbal working memory task",
          "( Jacobsen et al . 2007 ). Collectively , existing data<br>indicate some executive impairment and neural dysfunction<br>associated with adolescent marijuana use , although the<br>neural substrates specific to inhibitory processing have not<br>yet been examined in teenage marijuana users .",

          "The present results thus suggest that the effects of<br>cannabis use on brain function in adolescents may persist<br>after a period of abstinence .",
          "A pattern of increased activation yet comparable performance<br>is consistent with functional compensation and<br>dedifferentiation ( Rajah and D 'Esposito 2005 ) , which<br>supposes that loci of functional activity are spread to more<br>and larger regions .",
          "Therefore , adolescent marijuana users appear to recruit<br>more neural tissue in executive control areas to adequately<br>perform the task , which is consistent with other studies<br>showing increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation in MJ<br>users during inhibition ( Gruber and Yurgelun -Todd 2005 )<br>and other ( Schweinsburg et al . 2005b ) cognitive tasks .",

          "Synaptic pruning and gray matter sculpting occurs late in<br>some of the regions showing increased BOLD signal among<br>users , such as bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ,<br>where cortical thickness peaks at age 11.5 on average (<br>Gogtay et al . 2004 ; Sowell et al . 2003 ) .",
          "If prefrontal synaptic pruning is slowed by adolescent<br>marijuana use , greater activation may reflect excess neural<br>firing caused by a larger number of synaptic links .",
          "In their study of heavy marijuana -using adults , Gruber and<br>Yurgelun -Todd ( 2005 ) reported that heavy users had<br>increased prefrontal response to an inhibition task , as<br>seen in this study of adolescents , but also showed reduced<br>anterior cingulate response , which we did not observe in<br>this study .",
          "One possible explanation for this difference is the duration<br>of marijuana use in our cohort .",
          "It may take a longer period of use to evidence such changes<br>in cingulate responding .",
          "The increased parietal activation among marijuana -using<br>adolescents is consistent with findings from Jacobsen et al<br>. ( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .",
          "As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .",
          "Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .",
          "Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .",
          "Similarly , Chang et al . ( 2006 ) reported that adults who<br>started marijuana use in late adolescence had more frontal<br>activation during a visual attention task than adults who<br>started in early adolescence .",
          "Although our data do not address the molecular mechanism of<br>this difference , we can speculate about the nature of this<br>finding .",
          "For example , increased prefrontal activation during an<br>inhibitory task in adolescent users with a more recent onset<br>may reflect a stage of neural and behavioral compensation .",
          "This compensatory response may occur within the first few<br>years of regular adolescent marijuana use and may later be<br>followed by neuroadaptation or other processes , possibly<br>related to downregulation of cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors .",
          "Therefore , an inverted U -shaped response pattern may<br>emerge over time , which eventually results in brain<br>activation patterns that are indistinguishable from non<br>-users ( suggested in Fig . 2 ) . BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .",
          "Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased cerebral blood flow ( Mathew et al . 2002 ) and<br>volume ( Sneider et al . 2006 ) in frontal , insular ,<br>anterior cingulate , cerebellum , temporal , and paralimbic<br>regions ; reductions in auditory and visual cortex ,<br>parietal lobe , and thalamus ; and no change in nucleus<br>accumbens , basal ganglia , or the hippocampus ( O 'Leary et<br>al . 2002 ) .",
          "Although increases in blood flow velocity and<br>cerebrovascular resistance dissipate from 3 to 28 days of<br>abstinence in adults with marijuana use levels consistent<br>with this sample ( i.e . , 15.9 days per month ) , very<br>heavy users remained abnormally elevated ( Herning et al .<br>2005 ) .",
          "Thus , increased BOLD response in adolescent marijuana users<br>could reflect residual cerebrovasculature abnormalities ,<br>although increased blood flow or volume would likely yield<br>lower BOLD response ( Brown et al . 2003 ) , not greater ,<br>as seen here .",
          "This study had several limitations .",
          "While groups were equivalent on many demographic variables ,<br>intelligence , Fig . 2 Marijuana using adolescents ( n=16 )<br>show more BOLD response ( y -axis displays fit coefficients<br>) during inhibition trials relative to baseline than control<br>adolescents ( n=17 ) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex<br>, largely accounted for by users with 1 to 3 years of<br>regular ( weekly ) marijuana use and task performance ,<br>marijuana users had greater alcohol and other substance<br>histories and a trend for more depressed symptomatology .",
          "Although activation patterns remained after controlling for<br>these factors , substance and affective differences pose the<br>possibility of synergistic effects , and we have previously<br>found adolescent heavy drinking to be related to abnormal<br>activation patterns on a spatial working memory task",
          "( Caldwell et al . 2005 ;",
          "Schweinsburg et al .",
          "2005b ;",
          "Tapert et al . 2001 Tapert et al . , 2004 .",
          "Reduced educational engagement or altered sleep quality<br>related to marijuana use might account for the differences .",
          "Critically , the current data cannot ascertain if marijuana<br>use during adolescence produces the observed differences or<br>if abnormalities existed before the onset of regular use .",
          "Groups did not differ on proportion with a family history of<br>substance use disorder , and youths with psychiatric<br>diagnosis ( e.g . , conduct disorder , attention<br>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ) were excluded from the<br>study .",
          "Groups were similar with regard to most personality and<br>psychopathological syndrome dimensions but did differ on<br>openness to new experiences and parent report of delinquent<br>behaviors , which also may predate or result from adolescent<br>marijuana use , but did not account for group differences in<br>brain response .",
          "On the other hand , the adolescents who diverged most from<br>normal controls may simply differ on unmeasured risk factors<br>related to the initiation and escalation of substance use .",
          "Altered inhibitory processing may make adolescents<br>vulnerable to substance use initiation and escalation .",
          "The indication of extra neural effort required to inhibit<br>responses has important implications for adolescent<br>development and future substance involvement .",
          "Demands for inhibitory control increases substantially over<br>the course of late adolescence , particularly in school and<br>work environments as well as social and intimate<br>relationships .",
          "Consequently , youth required to exert extra neurocognitive<br>effort may be disadvantaged or become less successful in<br>maneuvering the normal transitions of adolescence and young<br>adulthood .",
          "Additionally , it may be harder for these youth to inhibit<br>the use of substances , particularly in situations where<br>cognitive demands are strained due to conflicting goals ,<br>distractions , peers , substance -relevant cues , or low<br>mood states ."

( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .\", \"As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .\", \"Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .\", \"Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .\", \"Similarly , Chang et al . ( 2006 ) reported that adults who<br>started marijuana use in late adolescence had more frontal<br>activation during a visual attention task than adults who<br>started in early adolescence .\", \"Although our data do not address the molecular mechanism of<br>this difference , we can speculate about the nature of this<br>finding .\", \"For example , increased prefrontal activation during an<br>inhibitory task in adolescent users with a more recent onset<br>may reflect a stage of neural and behavioral compensation .\", \"This compensatory response may occur within the first few<br>years of regular adolescent marijuana use and may later be<br>followed by neuroadaptation or other processes , possibly<br>related to downregulation of cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors .\", \"Therefore , an inverted U -shaped response pattern may<br>emerge over time , which eventually results in brain<br>activation patterns that are indistinguishable from non<br>-users ( suggested in Fig . 2 ) . BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .\", \"Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased cerebral blood flow ( Mathew et al . 2002 ) and<br>volume ( Sneider et al . 2006 ) in frontal , insular ,<br>anterior cingulate , cerebellum , temporal , and paralimbic<br>regions ; reductions in auditory and visual cortex ,<br>parietal lobe , and thalamus ; and no change in nucleus<br>accumbens , basal ganglia , or the hippocampus ( O 'Leary et<br>al . 2002 ) .\", \"Although increases in blood flow velocity and<br>cerebrovascular resistance dissipate from 3 to 28 days of<br>abstinence in adults with marijuana use levels consistent<br>with this sample ( i.e . , 15.9 days per month ) , very<br>heavy users remained abnormally elevated ( Herning et al .<br>2005 ) .\", \"Thus , increased BOLD response in adolescent marijuana users<br>could reflect residual cerebrovasculature abnormalities ,<br>although increased blood flow or volume would likely yield<br>lower BOLD response ( Brown et al . 2003 ) , not greater ,<br>as seen here .\", \"This study had several limitations .\", \"While groups were equivalent on many demographic variables ,<br>intelligence , Fig . 2 Marijuana using adolescents ( n=16 )<br>show more BOLD response ( y -axis displays fit coefficients<br>)

) marijuana use and task performance ,<br>marijuana users had greater alcohol and other substance<br>histories and a trend for more depressed symptomatology .\", \"Although activation patterns remained after controlling for<br>these factors , substance and affective differences pose the<br>possibility of synergistic effects , and we have previously<br>found adolescent heavy drinking to be

          "Marijuana users not only showed greater midcingulate and<br>reduced anterior cingulate blood oxygen level dependent (<br>BOLD ) response but also more widespread bilateral<br>dorsolateral prefrontal activation during inhibition<br>relative to color naming trials .",
          "The investigators speculated that the altered activation<br>pattern in marijuana users reflects compensation and use of<br>alternate strategies .",
          "The same investigators had shown in a previous f MRI study<br>using a working memory task before and after a 28 -day<br>abstinence period ( Yurgelun -Todd et al . 1998 ) that adult<br>users demonstrated less prefrontal and more anterior<br>cingulate response than controls after just 24 h of non -use<br>.",
          "Although users showed some normalization of prefrontal<br>functioning after 28 days of abstinence , they still showed<br>anterior cingulate dysfunction , which is supportive of<br>persisting neural processing abnormalities .",

          "However , most studies of adolescent marijuana users were<br>conducted after several days of abstinence , so effects<br>could be transitory .",
          "Jacobsen et al . ( 2004 ) addressed this concern by<br>evaluating seven adolescent marijuana users , seven<br>demographically similar tobacco smokers , and seven non<br>-users with a working memory task during f MRI acquisition<br>after about a month of abstinence .",
          "Marijuana users were less accurate on the task and showed<br>increased BOLD response in the right hippocampus relative to<br>other groups .",

          "Cannabis users , but not non -users , showed nicotine<br>withdrawal -precipitated increases in parietal activation<br>and disruptions in frontoparietal connectivity during a<br>verbal working memory task",
          "( Jacobsen et al . 2007 ). Collectively , existing data<br>indicate some executive impairment and neural dysfunction<br>associated with adolescent marijuana use , although the<br>neural substrates specific to inhibitory processing have not<br>yet been examined in teenage marijuana users .",

          "Blue areas show where users had more significantly BOLD<br>response during inhibition ( no -go ) trials relative to<br>baseline than non -users ( p<0.05 , clusters > 943 μl ) ; no<br>clusters in which users showed significantly less activation<br>than controls were found ( see Table 2 ) showed that adult<br>marijuana users exhibited increased prefrontal response<br>during inhibition tasks .",
          "The present results thus suggest that the effects of<br>cannabis use on brain function in adolescents may persist<br>after a period of abstinence .",
          "A pattern of increased activation yet comparable performance<br>is consistent with functional compensation and<br>dedifferentiation ( Rajah and D 'Esposito 2005 ) , which<br>supposes that loci of functional activity are spread to more<br>and larger regions .",
          "Therefore , adolescent marijuana users appear to recruit<br>more neural tissue in executive control areas to adequately<br>perform the task , which is consistent with other studies<br>showing increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation in MJ<br>users during inhibition ( Gruber and Yurgelun -Todd 2005 )<br>and other ( Schweinsburg et al . 2005b ) cognitive tasks .",
          "Repeated cannabinoid use may alter neuromaturation in<br>regions with high CB1 densities , such as prefrontal cortex<br>( Eggan and Lewis 2007 ) .",
          "Synaptic pruning and gray matter sculpting occurs late in<br>some of the regions showing increased BOLD signal among<br>users , such as bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ,<br>where cortical thickness peaks at age 11.5 on average (<br>Gogtay et al . 2004 ; Sowell et al . 2003 ) .",
          "If prefrontal synaptic pruning is slowed by adolescent<br>marijuana use , greater activation may reflect excess neural<br>firing caused by a larger number of synaptic links .",
          "In their study of heavy marijuana -using adults , Gruber and<br>Yurgelun -Todd ( 2005 ) reported that heavy users had<br>increased prefrontal response to an inhibition task , as<br>seen in this study of adolescents , but also showed reduced<br>anterior cingulate response , which we did not observe in<br>this study .",
          "One possible explanation for this difference is the duration<br>of marijuana use in our cohort .",
          "It may take a longer period of use to evidence such changes<br>in cingulate responding .",
          "The increased parietal activation among marijuana -using<br>adolescents is consistent with findings from Jacobsen et al<br>. ( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .",
          "As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .",
          "Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .",
          "Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .",
          "Similarly , Chang et al . ( 2006 ) reported that adults who<br>started marijuana use in late adolescence had more frontal<br>activation during a visual attention task than adults who<br>started in early adolescence .",
          "Although our data do not address the molecular mechanism of<br>this difference , we can speculate about the nature of this<br>finding .",
          "For example , increased prefrontal activation during an<br>inhibitory task in adolescent users with a more recent onset<br>may reflect a stage of neural and behavioral compensation .",
          "This compensatory response may occur within the first few<br>years of regular adolescent marijuana use and may later be<br>followed by neuroadaptation or other processes , possibly<br>related to downregulation of cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors .",
          "Therefore , an inverted U -shaped response pattern may<br>emerge over time , which eventually results in brain<br>activation patterns that are indistinguishable from non<br>-users ( suggested in Fig . 2 ) . BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .",
          "Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased cerebral blood flow ( Mathew et al . 2002 ) and<br>volume ( Sneider et al . 2006 ) in frontal , insular ,<br>anterior cingulate , cerebellum , temporal , and paralimbic<br>regions ; reductions in auditory and visual cortex ,<br>parietal lobe , and thalamus ; and no change in nucleus<br>accumbens , basal ganglia , or the hippocampus ( O 'Leary et<br>al . 2002 ) .",
          "Although increases in blood flow velocity and<br>cerebrovascular resistance dissipate from 3 to 28 days of<br>abstinence in adults with marijuana use levels consistent<br>with this sample ( i.e . , 15.9 days per month ) , very<br>heavy users remained abnormally elevated ( Herning et al .<br>2005 ) .",
          "Thus , increased BOLD response in adolescent marijuana users<br>could reflect residual cerebrovasculature abnormalities ,<br>although increased blood flow or volume would likely yield<br>lower BOLD response ( Brown et al . 2003 ) , not greater ,<br>as seen here .",
          "This study had several limitations .",
          "While groups were equivalent on many demographic variables ,<br>intelligence , Fig . 2 Marijuana using adolescents ( n=16 )<br>show more BOLD response ( y -axis displays fit coefficients<br>) during inhibition trials relative to baseline than control<br>adolescents ( n=17 ) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex<br>, largely accounted for by users with 1 to 3 years of<br>regular ( weekly ) marijuana use and task performance ,<br>marijuana users had greater alcohol and other substance<br>histories and a trend for more depressed symptomatology .",
          "Although activation patterns remained after controlling for<br>these factors , substance and affective differences pose the<br>possibility of synergistic effects , and we have previously<br>found adolescent heavy drinking to be related to abnormal<br>activation patterns on a spatial working memory task",

          "Marijuana users not only showed greater midcingulate and<br>reduced anterior cingulate blood oxygen level dependent (<br>BOLD ) response but also more widespread bilateral<br>dorsolateral prefrontal activation during inhibition<br>relative to color naming trials .",
          "The investigators speculated that the altered activation<br>pattern in marijuana users reflects compensation and use of<br>alternate strategies .",
          "The same investigators had shown in a previous f MRI study<br>using a working memory task before and after a 28 -day<br>abstinence period ( Yurgelun -Todd et al . 1998 ) that adult<br>users demonstrated less prefrontal and more anterior<br>cingulate response than controls after just 24 h of non -use<br>.",
          "Although users showed some normalization of prefrontal<br>functioning after 28 days of abstinence , they still showed<br>anterior cingulate dysfunction , which is supportive of<br>persisting neural processing abnormalities .",
          "These results support the hypothesis that adult marijuana<br>users show abnormal neural inhibitory processing ,<br>compensatory hyper -activity , and altered neural processing<br>differences in the absence of the intoxicating agent .",

          "However , most studies of adolescent marijuana users were<br>conducted after several days of abstinence , so effects<br>could be transitory .",
          "Jacobsen et al . ( 2004 ) addressed this concern by<br>evaluating seven adolescent marijuana users , seven<br>demographically similar tobacco smokers , and seven non<br>-users with a working memory task during f MRI acquisition<br>after about a month of abstinence .",
          "Marijuana users were less accurate on the task and showed<br>increased BOLD response in the right hippocampus relative to<br>other groups .",
          "The authors suggested that marijuana users might have failed<br>to inhibit hippocampal activity during the task , perhaps<br>due to cannabis -induced changes in inhibitory<br>neurotransmission or apoptosis in the hippocampus .",
          "These researchers then compared 15 adolescents with and 18<br>without histories of cannabis use during nicotine withdrawal<br>.",
          "Cannabis users , but not non -users , showed nicotine<br>withdrawal -precipitated increases in parietal activation<br>and disruptions in frontoparietal connectivity during a<br>verbal working memory task",
          "( Jacobsen et al . 2007 ). Collectively , existing data<br>indicate some executive impairment and neural dysfunction<br>associated with adolescent marijuana use , although the<br>neural substrates specific to inhibitory processing have not<br>yet been examined in teenage marijuana users .",
          "In the current study , we performed BOLD f MRI during a<br>go/no -go task to characterize response inhibition among<br>adolescent marijuana users and non -using controls .",

          "The go/no -go task ( Anderson et al . 2005 ; Schweinsburg et<br>al . 2004b ) was designed to assess inhibitory processing by<br>asking participants to withhold a response to an<br>infrequently occurring stimulus .",

          "Duration of regular marijuana use was negatively related to<br>no -go brain response in the right anterior superior frontal<br>gyrus ( BA 10 ; β=−0.73 , p<0.001 ; plotted in Fig . 2 ) ,<br>right superior middle frontal gyrus ( BA 6 ; β=−0.58 ,<br>p<0.025 ) , and left anterior superior frontal gyrus ( BA 10<br>; β=−0.58 , p < 0.025 ) , suggesting that youth with longer<br>durations of marijuana involvement had less no -go brain<br>response .",

          "In this study , marijuana -using adolescents showed<br>increased BOLD response during both inhibitory and non<br>-inhibitory trials of a go/no -go task , even after a 28<br>-day washout period of abstinence from cannabis , as<br>compared to control adolescents with limited substance use<br>histories .",
          "Differences were prominent in dorsolateral prefrontal and<br>parietal areas .",
          "Our findings with adolescent marijuana users extend those of<br>others ( Gruber and Yurgelun -Todd 2005 ) , who Fig . 1<br>Inhibition trial differences in BOLD response contrast<br>between marijuana -using ( n=16 ) and non -using ( n=17 )<br>adolescents after 28 days of monitored abstinence .",
          "Blue areas show where users had more significantly BOLD<br>response during inhibition ( no -go ) trials relative to<br>baseline than non -users ( p<0.05 , clusters > 943 μl ) ; no<br>clusters in which users showed significantly less activation<br>than controls were found ( see Table 2 ) showed that adult<br>marijuana users exhibited increased prefrontal response<br>during inhibition tasks .",
          "The present results thus suggest that the effects of<br>cannabis use on brain function in adolescents may persist<br>after a period of abstinence .",
          "A pattern of increased activation yet comparable performance<br>is consistent with functional compensation and<br>dedifferentiation ( Rajah and D 'Esposito 2005 ) , which<br>supposes that loci of functional activity are spread to more<br>and larger regions .",
          "Therefore , adolescent marijuana users appear to recruit<br>more neural tissue in executive control areas to adequately<br>perform the task , which is consistent with other studies<br>showing increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation in MJ<br>users during inhibition ( Gruber and Yurgelun -Todd 2005 )<br>and other ( Schweinsburg et al . 2005b ) cognitive tasks .",
          "Repeated cannabinoid use may alter neuromaturation in<br>regions with high CB1 densities , such as prefrontal cortex<br>( Eggan and Lewis 2007 ) .",
          "Synaptic pruning and gray matter sculpting occurs late in<br>some of the regions showing increased BOLD signal among<br>users , such as bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ,<br>where cortical thickness peaks at age 11.5 on average (<br>Gogtay et al . 2004 ; Sowell et al . 2003 ) .",
          "If prefrontal synaptic pruning is slowed by adolescent<br>marijuana use , greater activation may reflect excess neural<br>firing caused by a larger number of synaptic links .",
          "In their study of heavy marijuana -using adults , Gruber and<br>Yurgelun -Todd ( 2005 ) reported that heavy users had<br>increased prefrontal response to an inhibition task , as<br>seen in this study of adolescents , but also showed reduced<br>anterior cingulate response , which we did not observe in<br>this study .",
          "One possible explanation for this difference is the duration<br>of marijuana use in our cohort .",
          "It may take a longer period of use to evidence such changes<br>in cingulate responding .",
          "The increased parietal activation among marijuana -using<br>adolescents is consistent with findings from Jacobsen et al<br>. ( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .",
          "As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .",
          "Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .",
          "Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .",
          "Similarly , Chang et al . ( 2006 ) reported that adults who<br>started marijuana use in late adolescence had more frontal<br>activation during a visual attention task than adults who<br>started in early adolescence .",
          "Although our data do not address the molecular mechanism of<br>this difference , we can speculate about the nature of this<br>finding .",
          "For example , increased prefrontal activation during an<br>inhibitory task in adolescent users with a more recent onset<br>may reflect a stage of neural and behavioral compensation .",
          "This compensatory response may occur within the first few<br>years of regular adolescent marijuana use and may later be<br>followed by neuroadaptation or other processes , possibly<br>related to downregulation of cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors .",
          "Therefore , an inverted U -shaped response pattern may<br>emerge over time , which eventually results in brain<br>activation patterns that are indistinguishable from non<br>-users ( suggested in Fig . 2 ) . BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .",
          "Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased cerebral blood flow ( Mathew et al . 2002 ) and<br>volume ( Sneider et al . 2006 ) in frontal , insular ,<br>anterior cingulate , cerebellum , temporal , and paralimbic<br>regions ; reductions in auditory and visual cortex ,<br>parietal lobe , and thalamus ; and no change in nucleus<br>accumbens , basal ganglia , or the hippocampus ( O 'Leary et<br>al . 2002 ) .",
          "Although increases in blood flow velocity and<br>cerebrovascular resistance dissipate from 3 to 28 days of<br>abstinence in adults with marijuana use levels consistent<br>with this sample ( i.e . , 15.9 days per month ) , very<br>heavy users remained abnormally elevated ( Herning et al .<br>2005 ) .",
          "Thus , increased BOLD response in adolescent marijuana users<br>could reflect residual cerebrovasculature abnormalities ,<br>although increased blood flow or volume would likely yield<br>lower BOLD response ( Brown et al . 2003 ) , not greater ,<br>as seen here .",
          "This study had several limitations .",
          "While groups were equivalent on many demographic variables ,<br>intelligence , Fig . 2 Marijuana using adolescents ( n=16 )<br>show more BOLD response ( y -axis displays fit coefficients<br>) during inhibition trials relative to baseline than control<br>adolescents ( n=17 ) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex<br>, largely accounted for by users with 1 to 3 years of<br>regular ( weekly ) marijuana use and task performance ,<br>marijuana users had greater alcohol and other substance<br>histories and a trend for more depressed symptomatology .",
          "Although activation patterns remained after controlling for<br>these factors , substance and affective differences pose the<br>possibility of synergistic effects , and we have previously<br>found adolescent heavy drinking to be related to abnormal<br>activation patterns on a spatial working memory task",

          "Reduced educational engagement or altered sleep quality<br>related to marijuana use might account for the differences .",
          "Critically , the current data cannot ascertain if marijuana<br>use during adolescence produces the observed differences or<br>if abnormalities existed before the onset of regular use .",
          "Groups did not differ on proportion with a family history of<br>substance use disorder , and youths with psychiatric<br>diagnosis ( e.g . , conduct disorder , attention<br>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ) were excluded from the<br>study .",
          "Groups were similar with regard to most personality and<br>psychopathological syndrome dimensions but did differ on<br>openness to new experiences and parent report of delinquent<br>behaviors , which also may predate or result from adolescent<br>marijuana use , but did not account for group differences in<br>brain response .",
          "On the other hand , the adolescents who diverged most from<br>normal controls may simply differ on unmeasured risk factors<br>related to the initiation and escalation of substance use .",

          "Demands for inhibitory control increases substantially over<br>the course of late adolescence , particularly in school and<br>work environments as well as social and intimate<br>relationships .",
          "Consequently , youth required to exert extra neurocognitive<br>effort may be disadvantaged or become less successful in<br>maneuvering the normal transitions of adolescence and young<br>adulthood .",
          "Additionally , it may be harder for these youth to inhibit<br>the use of substances , particularly in situations where<br>cognitive demands are strained due to conflicting goals ,<br>distractions , peers , substance -relevant cues , or low<br>mood states ."

          "Many individuals first experiment with alcohol and drugs<br>during adolescence ( SAMHSA 2003 ) , and marijuana is the<br>most commonly used illicit substance among teenagers (<br>Johnston et al . 2005 ) .",
          "Nearly half of 12th graders have tried marijuana , and 6 %<br>disclose daily use ( Johnston et al . 2005 ) .",
          "Adolescence is also a period of continued neurodevelopment ,<br>including frontal lobe myelination and synaptic pruning that<br>subserve improved executive functioning ( Gogtay et al .<br>2004 ; Sowell et al . 2002 ) , including abilities such as<br>decision making , inhibitory processing , and impulse<br>control .",
          "The influence of marijuana use on these maturational<br>processes is unknown , although executive dysfunction may<br>affect the development and maintenance of substance use and<br>problems during adolescence ( Tapert et al . 2002a ) .",
          "Adults with heavy marijuana use histories have demonstrated<br>abnormalities in executive functioning ( Fletcher et al .<br>1996 ; Pope and Yurgelun Todd 1996 ; Solowij et al . 2002 )<br>and indices of frontal lobe operation ( Block et al . 2000 ;<br>Kanayama et al . 2004 ; Lundqvist et al . 2001 ; Solowij et<br>al . 1991 Solowij et al . , 1995 Struve et al . 1998 ) .",
          "To determine if cognitive deficits in marijuana users are<br>transient or persistent , Pope et al . ( 2001 ) tested 63<br>current marijuana users ( > 5,000 lifetime uses ) , 45<br>former users ( > 5,000 lifetime uses ) , and 72 normal<br>controls ( 1-50 lifetime uses ) , all ages 30-55 .",
          "Participants were abstinent for 28 days , verified by urine<br>drug screens and given neuropsychological tests on days 0 ,<br>1 , 7 , and 28 of abstinence .",
          "Current users showed some deficits relative to controls on<br>days 0 , 1 , and 7 , but groups did not differ on any test<br>by day 28 .",
          "In contrast , a study ( Bolla et al . 2002 ) that<br>hospitalized 22 marijuana -using adults ( > 2 years of<br>marijuana use ) for 28 days to assure abstinence found<br>greater marijuana intake linked to poorer performance on<br>tests of inhibition , problem solving , learning , and<br>reaction time .",
          "Disinhibition , i.e . , the impaired ability to inhibit a<br>potentially inappropriate response , is a common feature of<br>substance misuse ( Chen et al . 2007 ; Kamarajan et al .<br>2006 ; Kirisci et al . 2006 ; Verdejo -Garcia et al . 2006 )<br>.",
          "Neuroimaging studies have reported both prefrontal and<br>posterior parietal cortical involvement during inhibitory<br>processing in healthy volunteers ( Liu et al . 2004 ) ,<br>which may be overactive in populations with impulse control<br>problems ( Schulz et al . 2004 ) .",
          "Few studies have examined inhibitory processing in marijuana<br>users .",
          "Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( f MRI )<br>characterized the neural correlates of inhibition during a<br>Stroop task , in which heavy marijuana -using adults and non<br>-users were asked to inhibit the automatic process of<br>reading words and , instead , name the colors of words<br>printed in incongruent ink ( Gruber and Yurgelun Todd 2005 )<br>.",
          "Marijuana users not only showed greater midcingulate and<br>reduced anterior cingulate blood oxygen level dependent (<br>BOLD ) response but also more widespread bilateral<br>dorsolateral prefrontal activation during inhibition<br>relative to color naming trials .",
          "The investigators speculated that the altered activation<br>pattern in marijuana users reflects compensation and use of<br>alternate strategies .",
          "The same investigators had shown in a previous f MRI study<br>using a working memory task before and after a 28 -day<br>abstinence period ( Yurgelun -Todd et al . 1998 ) that adult<br>users demonstrated less prefrontal and more anterior<br>cingulate response than controls after just 24 h of non -use<br>.",
          "Although users showed some normalization of prefrontal<br>functioning after 28 days of abstinence , they still showed<br>anterior cingulate dysfunction , which is supportive of<br>persisting neural processing abnormalities .",
          "These results support the hypothesis that adult marijuana<br>users show abnormal neural inhibitory processing ,<br>compensatory hyper -activity , and altered neural processing<br>differences in the absence of the intoxicating agent .",
          "Few studies have examined neurocognitive effects of<br>marijuana use among adolescents , but some reports<br>identified decrements in attention ( Tapert et al . 2002b )<br>, and learning and memory ( Millsaps et al . 1994 ; Schwartz<br>et al . 1989 ) associated with early marijuana use .",
          "We previously demonstrated increased dorsolateral prefrontal<br>and decreased inferior frontal f MRI response during a<br>spatial working memory task among teens with comorbid<br>alcohol and marijuana use disorders compared to those with<br>alcohol use disorders alone and to non -using controls ,<br>suggesting a marijuana use -related increase in dorsolateral<br>prefrontal effort ( Schweinsburg et al . 2005b ) .",
          "However , most studies of adolescent marijuana users were<br>conducted after several days of abstinence , so effects<br>could be transitory .",
          "Jacobsen et al . ( 2004 ) addressed this concern by<br>evaluating seven adolescent marijuana users , seven<br>demographically similar tobacco smokers , and seven non<br>-users with a working memory task during f MRI acquisition<br>after about a month of abstinence .",
          "Marijuana users were less accurate on the task and showed<br>increased BOLD response in the right hippocampus relative to<br>other groups .",

          "If prefrontal synaptic pruning is slowed by adolescent<br>marijuana use , greater activation may reflect excess neural<br>firing caused by a larger number of synaptic links .",
          "In their study of heavy marijuana -using adults , Gruber and<br>Yurgelun -Todd ( 2005 ) reported that heavy users had<br>increased prefrontal response to an inhibition task , as<br>seen in this study of adolescents , but also showed reduced<br>anterior cingulate response , which we did not observe in<br>this study .",
          "One possible explanation for this difference is the duration<br>of marijuana use in our cohort .",
          "It may take a longer period of use to evidence such changes<br>in cingulate responding .",
          "The increased parietal activation among marijuana -using<br>adolescents is consistent with findings from Jacobsen et al<br>. ( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .",
          "As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .",
          "Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .",
          "Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .",
          "Similarly , Chang et al . ( 2006 ) reported that adults who<br>started marijuana use in late adolescence had more frontal<br>activation during a visual attention task than adults who<br>started in early adolescence .",
          "Although our data do not address the molecular mechanism of<br>this difference , we can speculate about the nature of this<br>finding .",
          "For example , increased prefrontal activation during an<br>inhibitory task in adolescent users with a more recent onset<br>may reflect a stage of neural and behavioral compensation .",
          "This compensatory response may occur within the first few<br>years of regular adolescent marijuana use and may later be<br>followed by neuroadaptation or other processes , possibly<br>related to downregulation of cannabinoid ( CB1 ) receptors .",
          "Therefore , an inverted U -shaped response pattern may<br>emerge over time , which eventually results in brain<br>activation patterns that are indistinguishable from non<br>-users ( suggested in Fig . 2 ) . BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .",
          "Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased cerebral blood flow ( Mathew et al . 2002 ) and<br>volume ( Sneider et al . 2006 ) in frontal , insular ,<br>anterior cingulate , cerebellum , temporal , and paralimbic<br>regions ; reductions in auditory and visual cortex ,<br>parietal lobe , and thalamus ; and no change in nucleus<br>accumbens , basal ganglia , or the hippocampus ( O 'Leary et<br>al . 2002 ) .",
          "Although increases in blood flow velocity and<br>cerebrovascular resistance dissipate from 3 to 28 days of<br>abstinence in adults with marijuana use levels consistent<br>with this sample ( i.e . , 15.9 days per month ) , very<br>heavy users remained abnormally elevated ( Herning et al .<br>2005 ) .",
          "Thus , increased BOLD response in adolescent marijuana users<br>could reflect residual cerebrovasculature abnormalities ,<br>although increased blood flow or volume would likely yield<br>lower BOLD response ( Brown et al . 2003 ) , not greater ,<br>as seen here .",
          "This study had several limitations .",
          "While groups were equivalent on many demographic variables ,<br>intelligence , Fig . 2 Marijuana using adolescents ( n=16 )<br>show more BOLD response ( y -axis displays fit coefficients<br>) during inhibition trials relative to baseline than control<br>adolescents ( n=17 ) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex<br>, largely accounted for by users with 1 to 3 years of<br>regular ( weekly ) marijuana use and task performance ,<br>marijuana users had greater alcohol and other substance<br>histories and a trend for more depressed symptomatology .",
          "Although activation patterns remained after controlling for<br>these factors , substance and affective differences pose the<br>possibility of synergistic effects , and we have previously<br>found adolescent heavy drinking to be related to abnormal<br>activation patterns on a spatial working memory task",
          "( Caldwell et al . 2005 ;",
          "Schweinsburg et al .",
          "2005b ;",
          "Tapert et al . 2001 Tapert et al . , 2004 .",
          "Reduced educational engagement or altered sleep quality<br>related to marijuana use might account for the differences .",
          "Critically , the current data cannot ascertain if marijuana<br>use during adolescence produces the observed differences or<br>if abnormalities existed before the onset of regular use .",
          "Groups did not differ on proportion with a family history of<br>substance use disorder , and youths with psychiatric<br>diagnosis ( e.g . , conduct disorder , attention<br>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ) were excluded from the<br>study .",
          "Groups were similar with regard to most personality and<br>psychopathological syndrome dimensions but did differ on<br>openness to new experiences and parent report of delinquent<br>behaviors , which also may predate or result from adolescent<br>marijuana use , but did not account for group differences in<br>brain response .",
          "On the other hand , the adolescents who diverged most from<br>normal controls may simply differ on unmeasured risk factors<br>related to the initiation and escalation of substance use .",
          "Altered inhibitory processing may make adolescents<br>vulnerable to substance use initiation and escalation .",
          "The indication of extra neural effort required to inhibit<br>responses has important implications for adolescent<br>development and future substance involvement .",
          "Demands for inhibitory control increases substantially over<br>the course of late adolescence , particularly in school and<br>work environments as well as social and intimate<br>relationships .",
          "Consequently , youth required to exert extra neurocognitive<br>effort may be disadvantaged or become less successful in<br>maneuvering the normal transitions of adolescence and young<br>adulthood .",
          "Additionally , it may be harder for these youth to inhibit<br>the use of substances , particularly in situations where<br>cognitive demands are strained due to conflicting goals ,<br>distractions , peers , substance -relevant cues , or low<br>mood states ."

( 2007 ) of heightened parietal response in marijuana<br>-involved youth during a verbal working memory task while<br>undergoing nicotine withdrawal , although here , nicotine<br>use rates were relatively low .\", \"As right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal regions have<br>been implicated in sustained attention ( Drummond et al .<br>2005 ) , perhaps , users had a greater cognitive load<br>associated with attending to the stimuli in general and in<br>identifying the no -go stimulus in particular .\", \"Both go and no -go trials require sustained attention , and<br>overlap was observed for the right prefrontal/insular and<br>parietal regions where users showed greater BOLD response<br>than controls for both conditions .\", \"Adolescents with later onsets ( age , 16-18 ) and briefer<br>durations ( 1-2 years ) of regular marijuana use showed the<br>greatest divergence from normal controls in BOLD response to<br>the inhibition trials .\", \"Similarly , Chang et al .

BOLD response is<br>influenced by cerebral blood flow , often abnormal in<br>marijuana users acutely and subacutely .\", \"Up to 36 h since last use , THC intake is associated with<br>increased
