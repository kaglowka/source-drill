For them, the interesting philosophical project is to determine how much, if any, of what we ordinarily think about various subject matters (e.g. the mental, the moral, the aesthetic) is compatible with our best scientific understanding of what there is. To decide this, special methods have been created for (1) perspicuously representing our folk commitments and (2) examining if these outstrip, or go beyond, the commitments of a certain scientific understanding of what there is in nature. By these lights the philosophical task of the naturalist is to determine if the folk are committed to something over and above what is posited by a certain scientific world view.

      "text" : "The tide is changing in the language sciences. For thepast twomillennia, the explananda of the language sciences have been inherited from the Western linguistic tradition and its many subsidiary practices. This traditiondnow massively institutionalized and authoritativedis conventionally traced back to ancient Greece and Rome, although it is important to recognize the continuously regenerative support that the tradition has received and continues to receive from cultural forms of metalinguistic discourse, including the institutionalized and normative practices of teaching language, translating it, writing it, reading it, editing it, ‘correcting’ and ‘improving’ it, and so on. This historydand its consequences for the language sciencesdhave been illuminatingly analyzed and meticulously described in the works of the late Roy Harris, as well as in the writings of many other scholars (Auroux, 1989; Baumann & Briggs, 2003; Harris, 1980, 1981, 1987; Harris & Taylor, 1997; Linell, 2005; Love, 2004; Reddy, 1979; Taylor, 1992).\ns and the explananda of the language sciences, New Ideas in 5.001\nAn important legacy of this history has been what we might call “the Western linguistic imaginary”: an indeterminate but deeply mesmerizing inventory of entities, properties, and powers commonly attributed to language and language-users and which therefore seem, to theorists of language, to stand in need of explanation. It is this cultural legacy of explananda that I am calling “folk-linguistic fictions”. Under the spell cast by this imaginary, language theorists from Plato to the present day have taken it to fall within their remit to provide explanations of such things as\nd what meanings are d what it is for an expression to refer to something d what a word is d what a sentence is d what a language is d what a dialect of a language is d what it is to mean such-and-such by what you say d what it is to understand what someone has said or written d what it is to say something about a situation or event d what it is for two instances of language to be the same word (or same sentence) or to have the same meaning d what it is for an instance of language to be true d what it is for an expression to be correctly formed d what it is for two (or two million) people to be speakers of (to know) the same language d what it is for two communicational agentsdin real time and concrete contexts, individually and in dialogic groups and time scalesdto ‘make use’ of these entities, properties, and powers.\nEtc. In addition, language theorists have also felt the need to explain how children so rapidly, and apparently without explicit instruction, gain command of these linguistic entities, properties, and powers.\nHowever, in recent years, epistemological developments in the philosophy of mind and the cognitive sciences have put the inherited assumptions about the explananda of the language sciences in a new light. Kitchener characterizes the naturalistic epistemology spreading through the cognitive sciences as follows:\nIf epistemology is to become thoroughly naturalistic and to employ the scientific method, then it would seem that all epistemological analyses must (in some sense) be empirical in nature, countenancing no nonnaturalistic entities, no non-naturalistic cognitive faculties, and no non-naturalisticmethods. Kitchener, 2006, p. 79\nWithin the cognitive sciences, naturalistic (or “naturalized”) research programs have succeeded in providing illuminating explanations of basic (“lower-order”) cognitive phenomena. (For an enlightening discussion see Hutto and Myin's Radicalizing Enactivism: Basic Minds without Content, 2013) The challenge today for the science of language is whether, in transforming itself along the lines demanded by epistemological naturalism, it can provide\nPlease cite this article in press as: Taylor, T. J., Folk-linguistic fiction Psychology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2015.0\nsimilarly illuminating explanations of any of its traditional explananda: that is, paraphrasing Kitchener, whether it can do so without countenancing any non-naturalistic entities or properties, without attributing any non-naturalistic powers to acts of language or to language-users, and without employing any non-naturalistic methods.\n2. The hard problem of folk linguistic fictions\nWhat, then, are naturalistically-inclined language scientists to dowith the fictions that are the legacy ofWestern culture's linguistic tradition? At least two alternatives present themselves.\nOne approach is to borrow the eliminativist strategy advocated by some cognitive scientists with regard to the analogous fictions of the folk psychology imaginary, such as the notions of ‘belief’, ‘idea’, ‘reason’, ‘wish’, ‘mental images’, and so on (cf. Braddon-Mitchell and Nola, 2009; Churchland, 2007; Greenwood, 1991; Stitch, 1996, Wheeler, 2005). Cognitive eliminativists claim that these notions are “the heritages of a timid savage past”, handed down, generation after generation, at mother's knee (Watson, 1924, p. 3) and that they now should be assigned the same fate as was meted out, following the birth of modern chemistry, to alchemical notions such as 'phlogiston', 'caloric', and 'essences'. For instance, the cognitive eliminativists Paul and Patricia Churchland argue that it is physical properties and processes in the brain which should be the ultimate explananda for scientific psychology and that folk psychological notions should be eliminated from scientific discourse. “[F]olk psychology is false, and its ontology is chimerical” (Churchland, 1991, p. 65). Another who argues against the reliance on folk psychology in cognitive research is the philosopher Dan Dennett. He illustrates his argument with this colorful thought experiment:\nSuppose we find a society that lacks our knowledge of human physiology, and that speaks a language just like English except for one curious family of idioms. When they are tired, they talk of being beset by fatigues, of having mental fatigues, muscular fatigues, fatigues in the eyes and fatigues of the spirit. Their sports lore contains such maxims as “too many fatigues spoils your aim” and “five fatigues in the legs are worth ten in the arms”. When we encounter them and tell them of our science, they want to know what fatigues are. They have been puzzling over such questions as whether numerically the same fatigue can come and go and return, whether fatigues have a definite location in matter and space and time, whether fatigues are identical with some particular physical states or processes or events in their bodies, or are made of some sort of stuff. We can see that they are off to a bad start with these questions, but what should we tell them? One thing we might tell them is that there simply are no such things as fatigues d they have a confused ontology. We can expect some of them to retort: “You don't think there are fatigues? Run around the block a few times and you'll know better! There are many things your science might teach us, but the non-existence of fatigues isn't\ns and the explananda of the language sciences, New Ideas in 5.001\n1 Cf. for some recent articles addressing these issues: Harvey (2015), Cuffari, Di Paolo, and De Jaegher (2014), Cowley (2011), Steffensen (2015), Raczaszek-Leonardi (2012), Thibault (2011), Cowley and Nash (2013). See also Maturana (1978).\none of them!” We ought to be unmoved by this retort. (…) Fatigues are not good theoretical entities, however well entrenched the term “fatigues” is in the habits of thought of the imagined society. The same is true, I hold, of beliefs, desires, pains, mental images, experiencesdas all these are ordinarily understood. Not only are beliefs and pains not good theoretical things (like electrons or neurons), but the state-of-believing-that-p is not a well-defined or definable theoretical state. Dennett, 1981, p. xixexx\nNow, from the perspective of a naturalistically-inclined language scientist, it is easy to see that, to the Churchlands' and Dennett's list of “bad theoretical entities”, one could add those explananda of the language sciences that are the legacy of the Western linguistic tradition: e.g., meanings, words, languages, reference, truth, names, understanding, and so on. Of course, to paraphrase Dennett, it is true that the “natives” who populate the linguistic community expect the language sciences to tell them “what these things are”: that is, these “things” which are regularly mentioned in everyday metalinguistic discourse about language in their community (e.g., in the Anglophone linguistic community). However, in keeping with Dennett's recommendation for commonsense psychological “things”, the naturalist language scientist should not be dissuaded from his eliminativist intentions. For, to put it in Dennett's terms, the natives in the Anglophone linguistic community have a confused ontology. (The same verdict would of course also apply to the natives of the thousands of other linguistic communities worldwide.) Meanings, words, languages, names, acts of reference, and so on are not “good theoretical things (like electrons or neurons)”. They are not admissible, as Hutto puts it in the quote at the head of the paper, within “our best scientific understanding of what there is”. Such a linguistic ontology is at best a comfortable cultural fiction, but a fiction nonetheless. And a naturalized linguistic science should not be the study of fictions, no matter how entrenched those fictions are in the habits of discourse among the ordinary members of the society. In addition, naturalist language scientists should refrain from characterizing their explanatory objects with folk metalinguistic expressions like “the English language”, “meaning”, “word”, “true”, “is about”, “name”, “implies”, “understands”, or any of the innumerable cultural variants that may be found in folk metalinguistic practices around the world.\nNot surprisingly, many of the theorists who are pioneering the naturalistic turn in the language sciences today draw back from adopting such an eliminativist strategy, at least when taken to such scorched-earth extremes. After all, does it not seem reasonable to expect that a scientific explanation of language should explain what it is to mean something when we speak and what it is for part of what we sayda worddto mean? Or to insist that language science must explain what a word is or what it is for two parts of an utterance (or of different utterances) to be instances of the same word e or to have the same meaning? And does it not seem equally reasonable to demand of language science that it explain what it is for an utterance to refer to or be about something or to be\nPlease cite this article in press as: Taylor, T. J., Folk-linguistic fiction Psychology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2015.0\ntrue of a state of affairs? Or what it is for two people to speak the same language? Should a science of language completely eschew the need to explain meaning, understanding, reference, truth, languages, words, grammaticality, etc.? And, if called upon to defend this sense of what is “reasonable”, might Dennett's “natives” not accuse the eliminativist of hypocrisy, asking himwhether they are to conclude from his argument that his utterances don't mean anything, that he is not referring to or talking about anything when he speaks, that he is not speaking a language, that what he says is neither true nor false, and that he doesn'tdindeed, could not possiblydeven understand what he is being asked? And, if the eliminativist remained stoic in his reply, couldn't they drive their objection home by asking him why he doesn't go through his daily life acting as if he actually believes all those eliminativist claims?\nOn the other hand, if eliminating all the “fictions” from the explananda of a naturalistically reconceived science of language seems an unreasonabledindeed, a nonsensical and self-contradictorydoption, what is the alternative? An alternative that has been adopted by many naturalist language scientists is to advocate only a limited eliminativism: that is, to seek ways to give naturalistic explanations of at least some folk-linguistic notions, while accepting that others, even most, are not legitimate explananda for the language sciences e that they are, in Dennett's phrase, members of a confused ontology. Not surprisingly, there is no consensus within naturalist language science regarding just which folk-linguistic notions should be treated as legitimate explananda (a.k.a. “linguistic facts”) and which are not good theoretical entities (“folk-linguistic fictions”). However, these disagreements need not detain us here. For the challenge which must be faced regardless of any particular language scientist's choice of legitimate explananda from among the legacies of the Western linguistic tradition is how any can be incorporated within the naturalistic epistemology of a redefined language science: that is, to paraphrase Kitchener, without countenancing any non-naturalistic entities or properties, without attributing any non-naturalistic powers to acts of language or to language-users, and without employing any non-naturalistic methods. The generalized version of this challenge might be given the title of “The Hard Problem of Language”, in analogy to Chalmers (1995) “Hard Problem of Consciousness” and Hutto and Myin's (2013) “Hard Problem of Content”: How can a naturalized science which has made such progress in explaining basic, pre- and non-linguistic cognitive phenomena, “scale-up” to explain more sophisticated, “higher-level” cognitive processes and phenomena, particularly those concerning language?1\nMy goal in this paper is to suggest a way of addressingdindeed, of defeatingdthis challenge by means of\ns and the explananda of the language sciences, New Ideas in 5.001\nreflecting on the everyday cultural practices of metalinguistic discourse."

      "text" : "In this Section I will merely give a summary of some of the most important and general conclusions that can be drawn from the last few decades' studies of folk metalinguistic practices. This summary draws on my own research as well as on that of anthropologists, developmental and social psychologists, descriptive linguists, rhetoricians, communication theorists, ethnomethodologists, discourse and conversation analysts, and sociolinguists.2 The most detailed and explicitly theorized study of folk metalinguistic (or “folk reflexive”) practices is to be found in Asif Agha's excellent Language and Social Relations (2007).\nBut first, consider the following examples of everyday metalinguistic remarks:\n“That's what she said” “What did he mean by that, anyway?” “I'm talking about the one on the left” “Sorry, could you say that again?” “Did she understand what you said?” “What does comely mean?” “That's not true!” “Yes, that's right.” “Why did he say that?” “Will you explain that?” “What's that called?” “Is this what you're referring to?” “I'll try to describe it to you.” “I don't agree with that remark.” “What's his name?” “No, soporific doesn't mean childish” “[ikanamɪks] and [ 3kanamɪks] are the same word” “I'm only teasing” “Do you understand?” “That's not what I told you to do” “Please don't lie to me.” “Promise me you won't go.” “He said he was sorry.” “She ordered me to leave.” “I believe you” “Really?” “I'm glad to hear it.” “Would you ask him to shut up?”\nRemarks like these occur as a regular feature of mundane conversational exchanges between English speakers. Yet such remarks are only the most quotable tips of discourse-interactional icebergs. What is at issue in this\n2 A selection of these is given in the references: Stross (1974), Silverstein (1985), Agar (1994), Silverstein and Urban (1996), Lucy (1993), Hanks (1993), Parmentier (1993), Hickmann (1993), Briggs (1993), Besnier (1993), Wolf et al. (1996), Bublitiz and Huber (2007), Jaworski, Coupland, and Galasinski (2004), Davis (2001), Hyland (2005), French (2010), Rumsey (1990, 2013), Danziger (2013), Danziger and Rumsey (2013), Nevins and Nevins (2013), Odango (2015).\nPlease cite this article in press as: Taylor, T. J., Folk-linguistic fiction Psychology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2015.0\npaper are the everyday discursive practices (conversational routines, language-games) in which such metalinguistic remarks occur, and are often responded to, and in which some aspect of language or language activity is (to use the Anglophone metalinguistic expression) “talked about”: referred to or appealed to, characterized, queried, commented on, objected to, defended, explained, made fun of, endorsed, sanctioned, described, and so on. Some additional examples of Anglophone folk metalinguistic practices are mentioned in Section 4 below.\nResearch in an increasingly wide range of language communities around the world indicates the following about metalinguistic practices.\n(i) Metalinguistic practices are pervasive and universal: a prevalent feature of daily life in every language, every culture.\n(ii) Although every language culture has and makes common use of metalinguistic practices, ethnographers have given abundant evidence of their diversity in forms of expression, meanings and discursive functions, and in cultural patterns of use. Metalinguistic practices vary non-isomorphically along many different dimensions and exhibit the same kinds and breadth of cultural diversity as do other linguisticcultural practices across and within speech communities worldwide. Agha refers to this diversity as a “central and inescapable fact about human societies… at any given time” (Agha, 2007, p. 1)\n(iii) Metalinguistic practices address an almost limitless range of linguistic referents, with those familiar to a speaker of English (e.g., ‘languages’, ‘names’, ‘meanings’, ‘descriptions’, ‘promises’, ‘implication’, etc.) having no privileged or universal status, despite the assumptions underlying the Western linguistic tradition. Becoming competent in another culture's metalinguistic practicesdespecially a culture that has escaped the influence of the ideological behemoth that is Western metalinguisticsdinduces a similar experience of d epaysement to that of becoming competent in its kinship systems, religious practices, social etiquette, plant taxonomies, folk psychologies, etc.\n(iv) Like all discursive practices, metalinguistic practices are multifunctional, exhibiting a diverse and contextually-shifting range of interactional purposes and uses, from the shaping of particular discursive events (such as the exchange of introductions between strangers, a prayer meeting, a public lecture, a business meeting, a court trial, a romantic date, gossiping, etc.) to the management of such matters as social relations, personal and cultural identities, classroom interaction, cooperative undertakings, institutional processes, etc.\n(v) Metalinguistic practices often have no uniquely identifying features, such as the use of particular sounds, words, formal patterns, etc. They are not separated off from, external to, or of a different logical order from other discursive activities. Like most of a culture's discursive practices or language-games, metalinguistic practices are “a motley, an open-ended, overlapping\ns and the explananda of the language sciences, New Ideas in 5.001\narray which do not fit together as parts of a singly systematically related totality” (Williams, 2010). As Agha points out: “The use of metalinguistic words and expressions is but a tiny fragment of the range of native metalinguistic practices which the ethnographer observes (…) and all such devices have other uses as well.” (Agha, 2007, p. 18e19)\n(vi) Metalinguistic activity “calls little attention to itself, despite its ubiquity” (Agha, 2007, p. 20). Speakers and hearers are often not aware of the metalinguistic character of such activities and may find it difficult to bring this to conscious awareness when questioned by ethnographers (Silverstein, 1981). Agha quotes Roman Jakobson (1960): “Like Moliere's Jourdain who used prose without knowing it, we practice metalanguage without realizing the metalingual character of our operations” (Agha, 2007, p. 18)\n(vii) Like all discursive practices, metalinguistic practices are normative: that is, one's participation in metalinguistic practicesdhow one produces or responds to a metalinguistic remarkdis the subject of normative attention and reflexive regulation (Heritage, 1984; Taylor, 1997).\n(viii) An essential component of the child's developing linguistic abilities and emerging membership of her linguistic community is her increasingly competent participation in metalinguistic practices, first in how she responds to the metalinguistic remarks of others and, as time progresses, in the production of metalinguistically-oriented remarks of her own (Hickmann, 1993; Taylor, 2012, 2013; WatsonGegeo & Gegeo, 1986)."

      "heading" : "4. A thought-experiment",
      "text" : "In discussing the character and function of folk metalinguistic practices it is instructive to consider what language and language activities would be like without them. Imagine a Twin Earth which has the following characteristics: the only language spoken on Twin Earth is identical with English as spoken on Earth, except that there are no means for engaging in metalinguistic discourse. So, although Twin-Earthlings produce words and utterances that sound exactly like the English words and sentences produced on Earth and although they appear to understand these words and sentences as English-speaking Earthlings do, nonetheless, Twin-Earthlings have no way of making the kind of metalinguistic remarks that are listed at the beginning of Section 3.\nShorn of these kinds of metalinguistic tools, a TwinEarthling cannot engage in metalinguistic practices such as explaining to someone what he is referring to or talking about. Nor can he ask someone else what they are referring to or talking about. That is, he cannot ask questions like “Which of them are you referring to?” or declare “I'm talking about that one, not the one over there”. He cannot request another Twin-Earthling to explain what she meant (by what she just said) or describe what he had understood\nPlease cite this article in press as: Taylor, T. J., Folk-linguistic fiction Psychology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2015.0\nher to mean. That is, a Twin-Earthling cannot do what we metalinguistically-endowed Earthlings in appropriate circumstances would call “explaining what I am referring to”, “saying what I am asking about”, “explaining what I meant”, or “saying what I understood”. Nor can he claimdor denydto be talking about the same thing (or event or idea, etc.) that someone else is talking about. And he cannot say what a particular expression means; he cannot even refer to it e nor, having spoken again, can he describe this as “repeating” or “saying again” what he said before.\nOn a Twin Earth devoid of metalinguistic practices, a speaker cannot deny or affirm the truth of what somebody says, or explain why it is true (or false). She cannot even state that she agrees or disagrees with what that person said. She cannot assert or deny that what you are doing is what she asked you to do e or that it is or isn't what you said you would do e and she cannot explain why that is so. She cannot characterize something she (or someone else) says as a promise, or as a threat, or as a prediction, or as a mistake, or as a lie, or as an order, or as her name. She is unable to claim that she understands (or does not understand) what someone just said; nor can she explain her reasons for that claim. She does not have the means to say whether what transpires is or isn't the same as what she (or someone else) said would happen. And she cannot claim that what you just said does or doesn't make sense or follow fromdor conflict withdwhat you (or someone else) said before.\nA Twin-Earthling cannot speak of a part of an utterance as aworddor of its meaning. She cannot even characterize what she just did as “saying” something. Nor can she speak of names (of places, people, etc.) or of languages e or, indeed, of language. She cannot assert that what someone says, or what she herself says, is correct or incorrect, is right or wrong, or is true or false. She cannot claim that how things actually are is or isn't in accord with the way that they were said to be. And so, naturally, there can be no disagreements over such claims.\nA Twin-Earthling parent cannot explain what he says to a child or correct the child's statement or use of a word, or make any other sort of comment about her linguistic behavior. He cannot ask what her name is. Nor can he explain to the child (or anyone else) that a particular utterance means you should or shouldn't do such-and-such or evaluate whether what she actually does is or isn't what shewas told to do. And noTwin-Earthling can read orwrite, because the practices by which one learns these activities must necessarily involve metalinguistic discourse.\nWithin language theory, the received view of folk metalinguistic practices is that they are epiphenomenal e trivial and supplementary add-ons to the real business of language: something like customized user-friendlyinterfaces with which different cultures over-lay the underlying linguistic operating system. However, what I believe this thought experiment shows is that being a competent speaker of Twin-Earthling English would be fundamentallydindeed, categoriallyddifferent from being a competent speaker of Earthling English. Indeed, it suggests that all language activities on a metalinguisticallydeprived Twin Earth would be immeasurably different fromdcould be nothing likedAnglophone language\ns and the explananda of the language sciences, New Ideas in 5.001\nactivities on Earth: that is, if a Twin-Earthling could do none of these ‘things’ that we Earthling Anglophones do in metalinguistic exchanges. To put this claim in positive terms: Anglophone language practices can only be what they aredthat is, what we Anglophones know and count on them to be, moment by moment, through every living daydbecause being a competent Anglophone necessarily includes being a competent participant in Anglophone metalinguistic practices. And, naturally, this positive claim applies mutatis mutandis to all forms of human languagingdi.e., to all ‘languages’dwhich makes the fact, as was noted above, that metalinguistic terms and practices vary widely and in unexpected ways among Earth's thousands of diverse linguistic communities infinitely more important to the study of language than is suggested by the metaphor of user-friendly cultural interfaces overlaying “the real business” of language. On the contrary, it is because of metalinguistic practices that the real business of language can take place at all.\nTo go one step further, it is worth asking how, shorn of metalinguistic practices, it would be possible for the cultural life of Twin-Earthlings to be anything like cultural forms of life on Earth. For instance, if it were not possible to speak metalinguistically of two utterances as meaning the same, or as not meaning the same, or of one of them as true or false, then how could two people have an argument, or cooperate in performing a complex task or solving a problem, or get married, or play games, or translate from another language, or make and enforce laws, or explain or object to someone's reasoning, or teach a child, or make and test predictions, or worship supernatural beings, or plan for the future? If it were not possible to affirm or deny that what someone is doing is the same as what we “told them to do”, or is or isn't “what we agreed”dand to hold such characterizations normatively accountabledthen how could the verbal-uttering part of language connect up with the ‘doing’ part? How could a kind of language shorn of metalinguistic practices possibly serve our human forms of living and doing and thinking and interacting in the countless ways, moment-to-moment, which we depend on language for? It would seem, I suggest, that we need metalinguistic practices not only in order for language to be the kind of thing we depend on language to be, but also in order for the forms of life we live and act and think in to exist at all.\n3 This rhetorical process of “theorizing language” is the topic of Taylor (1992, 1997)."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusions",
      "text" : "What conclusions might we then draw for the language sciences and the Hard Problem of Language?\n1. Instead of peripheralizing them, the sciences of language must move to the very center of their investigatory domain the folk metalinguistic practices by means of which ‘we’ (the various genera of ‘folk’) are constantly making and re-making language what it is for ‘us’, in our widely varying ways in cultural communities around the world e and, no less importantly, the means by which we make language what it is for us as humans.\nPlease cite this article in press as: Taylor, T. J., Folk-linguistic fiction Psychology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2015.0\n2. However, language science must resist the powerful inclination to reductively misrepresent such metalinguistic practices: in particular, by attributing the essential roles that they have in our forms of language and life as stemming from their purportedly propositional character. It is by these reductive means that are generated the folk-linguistic fictions that make up the furniture of the Western linguistic imaginary: that is, by decontextualizing customary utterances made in the course of folk metalinguistic practicesdand the commonplace generalizations derived from such utterancesdand recontextualizing them within the intellectual practices of empirical justification.3 In other words, mundane metalinguistic utterances such as “My name is ‘Margaret’” and “She is talking about her mother”dor the generalizations “Comely means ‘pleasing to look at’” and “[ikanamɪks] is the sameword as [ 3kanamɪks]”dare removed from their everyday interactional contexts and represented as empirical propositions. As such, they are treated as uniquely evaluable as true or false depending on whether the states of affairs they are taken to assert do in fact obtain: that is, whether the speaker's name actually is “Margaret”, whether the speaker referred to is in fact talking about her mother, whether the word comely really does mean ‘pleasing to look at’, and whether [ikanamɪks] truly is the same word as [ 3kanamɪks]. Accordingly, taking any such utterance as truedfor whatever reasondthus seems to presuppose a first-order linguistic fact requiring explanation: e.g., the metalanguage-independent fact that “Margaret” is the speaker's name or that comely means ‘pleasing to look at’. Yet a naturalistically-inclined language scientist should ask: What is the ontology of such facts? How is the naturalist to give such explananda an epistemologically satisfactory explanation: that is, to repeat Kitchener, “without countenancing any non-naturalistic entities or properties, without attributing any nonnaturalistic powers to acts of language or to languageusers, and without employing any non-naturalistic methods”? It is in the theorizing misrepresentation of the role of the commonplace remarks made within folk metalinguistic practices that we find the source of the Western linguistic imaginary, its reified “fictions”, and the resultant Hard Problem of Language. 3. A redefined language science would do well to accept as a fundamental principle that, within a culture's folk metalinguistic practices, issues concerning such things as word- and sentence-meanings, word-identity, languages, reference, understanding, correctness, etc. already have all the explanations that they require. These are explanations that are enacted and made to matter (in the only ways that they do matter) within the moment-to-moment, culturally-diverse, contextdependent, interactionally negotiated, and embodied practices of everyday metalinguistic discourse. While there is clearly much to research and explain in the sciences of language for which a naturalistic approach is\ns and the explananda of the language sciences, New Ideas in 5.001\nmost appropriately suited, the real challenge is to resist the temptation to present the results of such research as natural-science explanations of the reified fictions of the Western linguistic imaginary."

    "abstractText" : "For the past two millennia, the explananda of language theory have been inherited from the Western linguistic tradition. The legacy is what might be called “the Western linguistic imaginary”: An indeterminate but deeply mesmerizing inventory of entities, properties, and powers of language commonly attributed to language and language-users and which therefore seem to stand in need of explanation. In recent years, naturalistic research programs in the cognitive sciences have provided illuminating explanations of basic (“lower-order”) cognitive phenomena. The challenge today for the science of language is whether, in transforming itself along the lines of epistemological naturalism, it can provide similarly illuminating explanations of any of its traditional explananda. In addressing this challenge, greater attention needs to be given to the source of such explananda in the everyday, culturally-diverse practices of folk metalinguistics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Some naturalists take a special interest in our everyday or folk commitments. For them, the interesting philosophical project is to determine how much, if any, of what we ordinarily think about various subject matters (e.g. the mental, the moral, the aesthetic) is compatible with our best scientific understanding of what there is. To decide this, special methods have been created for (1) perspicuously representing our folk commitments and (2) examining if these outstrip, or go beyond, the commitments of a certain scientific understanding of what there is in nature. By these lights the philosophical task of the naturalist is to determine if the folk are committed to something over and above what is posited by a certain scientific world view.
