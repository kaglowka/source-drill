          "The general knew that an attack by his entire army would<br>capture the fortress",
          "The general picture appears to be that dissimilar training<br>examples make it more difficult to learn concept but allow<br>it to be used more flexibly once acquired",
          "The general solution is to divide his army into small groups<br>send each group to the head of different road and have the<br>groups converge simultaneously on the fortress",

          "The headquarters was located on heavily guarded island<br>situated in the center of lake",
          "The hint was quite nonspecific as subjects were told nothing<br>about how the story might help however it obviated any need<br>for subjects to spontaneously notice the potential analogy",
          "The idea of using different directions was inferred if the<br>subject mentioned the simultaneous use of multiple forces",
          "The influence of the analogy was very pronounced",
          "The initial mapping then constitutes an invitation to pursue<br>the metaphor further",
          "The interpretation of metaphor thus seems to begin with<br>detection of salient initial correspondences followed by the<br>construction of others Chap chically into an initial state<br>goals available resources and constraints solution plan and<br>an actual or anticipated outcome of realizing the plan",
          "The later accessibility of an analog should therefore be<br>especially dependent on the nature of its initial encoding",
          "The latter subject reported solving the radiation problem<br>without thinking of the diagrams",
          "The manipulations used were summarization of the prior<br>analog as opposed to rote recall provision of verbal<br>statement of the implicit schema as part of the story and<br>provision of diagrammatic representation of the schema",
          "The mapping process presents particularly formidable<br>problems that must be solved in order to construct process<br>model of analogical thinking and computational<br>implementations have tended to invoke algorithms that would<br>unduly strain the capacity limits of human working memory",

          "The notion that summarization might foster schema<br>abstraction acquires degree of plausibility from evidence<br>that summaries as compared with recall protocols typically<br>include proportionately greater number of propositions drawn<br>from higher levels of representational hierarchy",
          "The observed pattern is certainly consistent with the view<br>that the task of evaluating story similarities invokes<br>mapping process which may lead to the incidental abstraction<br>of problem schema the more closely the induced schema<br>approximates the optimal convergence schema the more likely<br>the person is to notice its relevance to the subsequent<br>transfer problem and to be able to derive the appropriate<br>solution",
          "The only way to reach the island was by way of several<br>pontoon bridges that connected it to the surrounding area",

          "The other pair of stories shared fire fighting theme",
          "The overall relationship between schema quality and solution<br>generation was less robust for the without principle<br>condition G2 due to the lack of clear differences between<br>subjects who gave good versus intermediate schemas",
          "The percentage of subjects producing the analogous solution<br>to the target problem on their first pass provides measure<br>of spontaneous noticing and application the total percentage<br>of subjects producing the solution on either pass provides<br>measure of potential application given that the analogy has<br>been noticed",

          "The radiation problem due to its ill defined nature meets<br>the second requirement",
          "The radiation problem was then presented in the usual two<br>pass manner except that the final questionnaire asked<br>subjects to write down solution suggested by either one or<br>both of the prior stories",

          "There was enough foam available at the site to do the job",
          "There was no indication that spatial diagrams any more than<br>the verbal statement used in Experiment constituted an<br>effective addition to the basic story analog",

          "These central results as well as other more detailed<br>findings e.g the extreme separation of noticing from<br>application in the case of diagrammatic analogy presented<br>alone support our analyses of analogical mapping schema<br>formation and semantically driven retrieval",

          "This comparison yielded clear differences",
          "This does not mean however that the verbal principle was<br>totally ineffective because substantial proportion of<br>subjects in the principleonly condition also produced the<br>convergence solution",

          "Furthermore in complex domains much of the detailed<br>knowledge shared by experts particularly procedural<br>knowledge is likely to be implicit and not easily verbalized",

          "Assuming that about of subjects would produce the solution<br>in the absence of any analogy figure based on several<br>replications these results indicate that only third or less<br>of the subjects who could potentially apply the analogy<br>spontaneously noticed it",
          "At least the latter figure is not remarkably different from<br>figures obtained in previous experiments with single prior<br>analog which might seem to contradict our prediction that<br>reasoning from schema will be more effective than reasoning<br>from an analog",

          "Augmenting an example with principle may be beneficial when<br>the information is presented in an explicit problem solving<br>context rather than in an incidental task",
          "Because experts tend to encode problems at relatively<br>abstract level Chi it follows that expert knowledge of one<br>domain should tend to enable analogical transfer to another",
          "Because the experimental situations differed in many ways<br>e.g the cord problem is somewhat easier to solve in the<br>absence of an analogy strong conclusions are unwarranted",

          "But as was the case with the verbal statement used in<br>Experiment scrutiny of subjects story protocols indicated<br>that nothing of the sort actually occurred",
          "But because the two stories were totally disanalogous except<br>that both described problem situations the resulting schemas<br>were invariably poor indeed very poor approximations to the<br>convergence schema",
          "But by its very nature an analog from disparate domain will<br>lack such transparent resemblances",
          "But if the diagrams can indeed be interpreted as an abstract<br>analog to the radiation problem why did they not facilitate<br>analogical transfer when presented in the context of the<br>military story",
          "But once subjects had been explicitly told to consider the<br>prior diagrams they were able to interpret them by means of<br>mapping process",
          "But somewhat surprisingly the relationship was far less<br>strong when the prior analogs were similar G2",
          "But such abstract analogies will seldom trigger development<br>of realizable solution procedure",
          "But whereas direct attack on the fortress would endanger the<br>army direct treatment of the tumor would not endanger the<br>rays",
          "But while we do not have formal metric of analogical<br>similarity with which to compare such diverse analogies as<br>the military and radiation problems versus the ribbon and<br>cord problems it is intuitively compelling that the analog<br>is semantically closer to the target problem in the latter<br>case",
          "But with only small buckets to work with it was hard to make<br>any headway",
          "By varying the solution provided in the military story we<br>were able to selectively facilitate the discovery of various<br>alternative potential solutions to the radiation problem",
          "Calling it the convergence solution emphasizes its central<br>property the convergence of multiple forces on the target",
          "Combining both conditions of subjects produced good schemas<br>produced intermediate schemas and the majority produced poor<br>schemas",

          "Consequently the potential semantic links between two<br>dissimilar analogs will simply correspond to the basis of<br>the analogy the identities that comprise the implicit schema<br>embedded within each analog",
          "Consequently the various inference processes required for<br>everyday understanding will often play important roles in<br>analogical thinking",

          "Everything was just about ready and it was fifteen minutes<br>before the children were supposed to come",
          "Except for references to the diagrams there were no obvious<br>differences between the summaries written by subjects in the<br>analog plus diagrams conditions and those written by<br>subjects in the analog only condition",
          "Experiment Although the problems used in our experiments<br>have always been stated verbally they are fundamentally<br>spatial in nature",
          "Experiment The failure of summarization instructions to<br>foster abstraction of problem schema from story analog is<br>not surprising given the nondirec tive nature of the<br>manipulation",

          "Experiment introduced what would seem to be more direct<br>approach the story analog was augmented by an explicit<br>verbal statement of the principle underlying the implicit<br>problem schema",
          "Experiment investigated this same issue using different<br>transfer problem since the exclusive use of the radiation<br>problem is an obvious limitation of our previous research<br>Method",
          "Experiment therefore examined the effect of adding the<br>verbal statement used previously in Experiment to two prior<br>analogs.kfethod To simplify the experimental design only one<br>pair of dissimilar story analogs were used The General and<br>The Fire Chief",
          "Experiment thus yielded no support for the hypothesis that<br>augmenting the story analog with verbal principle would<br>increase analogical transfer",
          "Experiment was designed to seek comparable effects of visual<br>representation of the principle",
          "Experiment yielded clear evidence that problem schema can be<br>induced by mapping two analogs and that the quality of that<br>schema predicts subsequent transfer performance",
          "Finally since mapped elements relations and properties and<br>their arguments are typically similar but not identical they<br>must be decomposable into identities and differences",
          "Finally subjects in the principle alone condition did not<br>receive the story but only the bare statement of the<br>principle",

          "For example ribbons and cords are much more similar than are<br>armies and rays both pendulum solutions accomplish goal of<br>tying while the analogous convergence solutions serve either<br>to capture or to destroy",
          "For example suppose we assert that Analogy is window on the<br>mind",
          "For example the Kintsch and van Dijk model suggests that<br>multiple levels of macrostructure are derived in either case<br>summaries may be briefer than recall protocols due to<br>differences in output processes rather than to differences<br>in the internal representations of the story",
          "For example the goal of overcoming target is instantiated as<br>capturing fortress in the military story and as destroying<br>tumor in the radiation problem",
          "For example the goal of using the army to capture the<br>fortress maps onto the goal of using the rays to destroy the<br>tumor",
          "For example the principle refers to accomplishing some<br>purpose whereas the corresponding core idea in the stories<br>is the more specific relation of overcoming",
          "For example the role of the army in the military story<br>usually corresponds to the role of the rays in the medical<br>problem",
          "For example they may have noticed the abstract similarity of<br>the large unidirectional arrow to the desirable but blocked<br>possibility of directing high intensity rays at the tumor",

          "For while it is not essential to map all aspects of the two<br>analogs indeed this will seldom be possible those aspects<br>which constitute the causal antecedents of the known outcome<br>obtained in the referent analog must be mappable",
          "Fortunately the shed was right beside lake so there was<br>plenty of water available",
          "Forty five percent of subjects in the two analog conditions<br>generated the convergence solution prior to the hint as<br>opposed to only of subjects in the one analog condition G2",

          "Furthermore in complex domains much of the detailed<br>knowledge shared by experts particularly procedural<br>knowledge is likely to be implicit and not easily verbalized",

          "Furthermore none of these manipulations appeared to foster<br>abstraction of general problem schema from one example even<br>though the verbal statement amounted to an explicit<br>statement of such schema and both the verbal statement and<br>the diagram produced transfer when presented alone although<br>in the latter case only with hint",
          "Furthermore small window often allows only partial view of<br>what lies beyond intimating that analogy may provide limited<br>and selective insights and so on",

          "Assuming that about of subjects would produce the solution<br>in the absence of any analogy figure based on several<br>replications these results indicate that only third or less<br>of the subjects who could potentially apply the analogy<br>spontaneously noticed it",
          "At least the latter figure is not remarkably different from<br>figures obtained in previous experiments with single prior<br>analog which might seem to contradict our prediction that<br>reasoning from schema will be more effective than reasoning<br>from an analog",

          "Augmenting an example with principle may be beneficial when<br>the information is presented in an explicit problem solving<br>context rather than in an incidental task",
          "Because experts tend to encode problems at relatively<br>abstract level Chi it follows that expert knowledge of one<br>domain should tend to enable analogical transfer to another",
          "Because the experimental situations differed in many ways<br>e.g the cord problem is somewhat easier to solve in the<br>absence of an analogy strong conclusions are unwarranted",
          "Because the instructions emphasized verbatim recall subjects<br>may have refrained from doing any kind of abstraction that<br>might have highlighted the convergence schema implicit in<br>the story",
          "Because the optimal convergence schema is quite abstract it<br>would seem that the mapped identities linking two relatively<br>dissimilar analogs would more likely correspond to an<br>optimal schema because they are similar only at an abstract<br>level",
          "Because the present experiments used subjects drawn from<br>essentially the same subject population we assumed base rate<br>of for producing the critical solution without an analogy",
          "Because these two conditions that received two analogs also<br>did not differ in total solution frequencies they were<br>combined in order to make comparison with the one analog<br>plus control condition",
          "Because this pattern did not differ significantly as<br>function of whether diagrams were provided the data have<br>been collapsed across that variable",
          "Before distribution of the stories subjects were told either<br>that they would have to summarize or else recall the story<br>later so they should pay attention to the major points of<br>the story summary conditions or else learn it in as much<br>detail as possible analog recall condition",
          "But as was the case with the verbal statement used in<br>Experiment scrutiny of subjects story protocols indicated<br>that nothing of the sort actually occurred",
          "But because the two stories were totally disanalogous except<br>that both described problem situations the resulting schemas<br>were invariably poor indeed very poor approximations to the<br>convergence schema",
          "But by its very nature an analog from disparate domain will<br>lack such transparent resemblances",
          "But if the diagrams can indeed be interpreted as an abstract<br>analog to the radiation problem why did they not facilitate<br>analogical transfer when presented in the context of the<br>military story",
          "But once subjects had been explicitly told to consider the<br>prior diagrams they were able to interpret them by means of<br>mapping process",
          "But somewhat surprisingly the relationship was far less<br>strong when the prior analogs were similar G2",
          "But such abstract analogies will seldom trigger development<br>of realizable solution procedure",
          "But whereas direct attack on the fortress would endanger the<br>army direct treatment of the tumor would not endanger the<br>rays",
          "But while we do not have formal metric of analogical<br>similarity with which to compare such diverse analogies as<br>the military and radiation problems versus the ribbon and<br>cord problems it is intuitively compelling that the analog<br>is semantically closer to the target problem in the latter<br>case",
          "But with only small buckets to work with it was hard to make<br>any headway",
          "By varying the solution provided in the military story we<br>were able to selectively facilitate the discovery of various<br>alternative potential solutions to the radiation problem",
          "Calling it the convergence solution emphasizes its central<br>property the convergence of multiple forces on the target",
          "Combining both conditions of subjects produced good schemas<br>produced intermediate schemas and the majority produced poor<br>schemas",
          "Combining the two analog conditions of their subjects<br>produced the convergence solution without the hint as<br>compared to only one of the diagrams only subjects",
          "Combining the two analog conditions subjects who received<br>the analogous story produced more pendulum solutions prior<br>to the hint than did those who received the control story vs<br>G2 OOl",
          "Consequently the potential semantic links between two<br>dissimilar analogs will simply correspond to the basis of<br>the analogy the identities that comprise the implicit schema<br>embedded within each analog",
          "Consequently the various inference processes required for<br>everyday understanding will often play important roles in<br>analogical thinking",

          "Differences between analogs are not always structure<br>preserving",

          "Eighty eight subjects participated in the experiment<br>distributed approximately equally across the three<br>conditions",

          "Everything was just about ready and it was fifteen minutes<br>before the children were supposed to come",
          "Except for references to the diagrams there were no obvious<br>differences between the summaries written by subjects in the<br>analog plus diagrams conditions and those written by<br>subjects in the analog only condition",
          "Experiment Although the problems used in our experiments<br>have always been stated verbally they are fundamentally<br>spatial in nature",
          "Experiment The failure of summarization instructions to<br>foster abstraction of problem schema from story analog is<br>not surprising given the nondirec tive nature of the<br>manipulation",
          "Experiment explicitly compared the effectiveness of two vs<br>one prior analogs in producing analogical transfer",
          "Experiment introduced what would seem to be more direct<br>approach the story analog was augmented by an explicit<br>verbal statement of the principle underlying the implicit<br>problem schema",
          "Experiment investigated this same issue using different<br>transfer problem since the exclusive use of the radiation<br>problem is an obvious limitation of our previous research<br>Method",
          "Experiment therefore examined the effect of adding the<br>verbal statement used previously in Experiment to two prior<br>analogs.kfethod To simplify the experimental design only one<br>pair of dissimilar story analogs were used The General and<br>The Fire Chief",

          "Experiment was designed to seek comparable effects of visual<br>representation of the principle",
          "Experiment yielded clear evidence that problem schema can be<br>induced by mapping two analogs and that the quality of that<br>schema predicts subsequent transfer performance",
          "Finally since mapped elements relations and properties and<br>their arguments are typically similar but not identical they<br>must be decomposable into identities and differences",
          "Finally subjects in the principle alone condition did not<br>receive the story but only the bare statement of the<br>principle",
          "Finally subjects were asked to rate the similarity of the<br>two stories on point scale",

          "We have chosen to refer to CPP as protocol for measuring<br>drug reward rather than reinforcement in order to<br>distinguish it from the drug self administration protocol",
          "Reinforcement is typically defined as any experimental<br>contingency operant or Pavlovian that increases the<br>probability of class of behaviors whereas reward typically<br>refers to the appetitive nature of given stimulus",
          "Since it is not clear what class of behaviors are reinforced<br>during CPP conditioning trials the term reward seems more<br>appropriate to describe drug induced CPP",
          "As an experimental protocol for measuring drug reward we<br>will provide an overview of the critical theoretical issues<br>relevant to this protocol especially as it relates to the<br>selfadministration protocol",
          "In addition we will provide critical summary of the<br>advantages and limitations of the protocol",
          "That is when should CPP be used and when should it not be<br>used",
          "Each of these issues is addressed using question and answer<br>format",
          "We have not attempted to provide comprehensive or<br>bibliographic compilation of all available CPP studies in<br>answering the posed questions as number of comprehensive<br>reviews of the CPP literature are already available Carr<br>Bardo",
          "CPP has become popular alternative to drug self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr",
          "Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg",
          "In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter",
          "After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that hid syringe filled<br>with their daily dose of morphine and black box that hid<br>banana",
          "When deprived of morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the<br>white box but when pretreated with their daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box",
          "Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure",
          "Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired black arm in non dependent<br>rats indicating that the induction of physical dependence is<br>not prerequisite for obtaining CPP",
          "Following this demonstration of CPP using discrete trial<br>choice procedure Rossi and Reid published report of morphine<br>CPP in which the duration of time spent in morphine paired<br>context relative to saline paired context was used as the<br>index of preference",
          "To date the general procedure described by Rossi and Reid<br>has been adopted for essentially all subsequent CPP studies<br>with some modifications",
          "Although methodological details differ among laboratories<br>typical CPP experiment includes differentially pairing two<br>distinct sets of environmental contextual cues with the<br>stimulus of interest e.g drug food copulatory opportunity",
          "The contextual cues tend to differ along several stimulus<br>dimensions",
          "For example the contexts may vary in flooring size or shape<br>wall color or pattern and olfactory cues",
          "Conditioning involves an animal receiving repeated access to<br>the appetitive stimulus termed unconditioned stimulus or US<br>in one context termed conditioned stimulus or CS",
          "Intermixed with these context US pairings is similar<br>exposure to the other context without the US.Following<br>conditioning is choice test in which animals receive<br>unrestricted exposure to both contexts in the absence of the<br>US",
          "An increase in time spent in the paired context relative to<br>control value is taken as evidence that the US was rewarding",
          "Presumably the learned association between the context CS<br>and the US results in animals spending more time in that<br>context",
          "Research has shown that wide array of stimuli can condition<br>an increase in preference",
          "For example access to natural appetitive stimuli like food<br>Spyraki water Ågmo sweet fluids conspecific interaction<br>wheel running Antoniadis copulation Meisel and novel stimuli<br>can condition preferences in rodents",
          "These preferences are subject to changes in motivational<br>state as food deprived rats will prefer context previously<br>paired with food whereas water deprived rats will prefer<br>context previously paired with water",
          "Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see",
          "Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process",
          "An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement",
          "Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership",
          "The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool",
          "The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward",
          "logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward",
          "This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training",
          "Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes",
          "On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered",
          "see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species",
          "Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and self<br>administration",
          "In contrast neither CPP nor self administration is produced<br>by host of other drug classes including antagonists for<br>dopamine opioid and cholinergic receptors as well as<br>antidepressants that work on either noradrenergic or<br>serotonergic systems",
          "Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes",
          "Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine",
          "Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process",
          "Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose",
          "In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration",
          "In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats",
          "Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated",
          "In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue",
          "Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained",
          "These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes",
          "There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable",
          "Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats",
          "In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker",
          "This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips",
          "Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine",
          "Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine",
          "One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter",
          "This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal",

          "In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process",

          "In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning",
          "That is the CS must occur close in time with the US",
          "In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the paired context",
          "Presumed early failures in contiguity theory however lead to<br>the competing theoretical position that information or<br>predictive and non redundant relation between the CS and US<br>was required for the acquisition of conditioned association",
          "In CPP experiments there tends to be perfect predictive<br>relation between the context CS and drug administration the<br>drug US and context CS always co occur",
          "Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory",
          "This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g",
          "For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS",
          "The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control",
          "However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g",
          "This conditioning results from accidental contiguous<br>pairings of the CS and US early in training even though<br>there is no overall predictive relation between the CS and<br>US",

          "In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS",
          "Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment",
          "That is what becomes associated with the context CS",
          "Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf",
          "As argued earlier the CPP protocol provides measure of the<br>rewarding effect of the drug US similar to that postulated<br>by opponent process theories",

          "That is the measure of drug reward increased time in CXT<br>might include approach to CXT as well as avoidance of CXTIn<br>this section we have not provided an exhaustive review of<br>all theoretical issues relevant to CPP",
          "For example recent and interesting theoretical view termed<br>the temporal coding hypothesis argues that acquisition of<br>conditioned association is dependent on contiguity between<br>the CS and US Barnet",
          "Automatically acquired as part of this association is when<br>the US occurs in relation to the CS i.e temporal coding",
          "Simply stated for the CPP protocol did the rewarding effect<br>occur before or after the context CS",

          "There are clear biological changes in an organism over time",
          "As time passes these stimuli also change thus altering<br>expression of conditioning Bouton for differing view see<br>Riccio",
          "In comprehensive review Carr indicated that the major<br>advantages of CPP are that it is sensitive to low drug doses<br>can be obtained using only single drug pairing measures both<br>reward and aversion is tested when the animal is in drug<br>free state does not require surgical procedure and controls<br>for drug dosing",
          "Among these advantages the ability of CPP to measure drug<br>reward using single contextdrug US pairing is perhaps the<br>most unique advantage",
          "With drug self administration repeated self infusions of<br>drug are required in order to establish reliable behavior<br>and this repeated exposure protocol likely affects receptor<br>transduction mechanisms related to tolerance andor<br>sensitization",
          "In contrast single trial CPP has been demonstrated with<br>morphine Mucha cocaine and amphetamine This procedural<br>advantage allows for determining drug reward without any<br>induction of tolerance or sensitization",
          "Such information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen",
          "In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention",
          "One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward",
          "This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation",
          "Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas",
          "With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system",
          "Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure",
          "Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine",
          "Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats",
          "For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes",
          "Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP",
          "This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity",
          "Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu",
          "Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual",
          "Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice",
          "This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects",
          "One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward",
          "CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL",
          "The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest",
          "CPP allows for such rapid screening",
          "Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve",
          "This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford",
          "Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward",
          "Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose",
          "That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded",
          "Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo",
          "In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context",
          "More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs",
          "Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward",
          "For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion",
          "Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion",
          "One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day",
          "It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context",
          "Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day",
          "While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking",
          "Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired",
          "When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation",
          "Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning",
          "An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context",
          "That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state",
          "While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel",
          "However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted",
          "In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning",
          "In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology",
          "Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals",
          "This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested",
          "Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses",
          "This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve",
          "Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive",
          "Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs",
          "strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference",
          "Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context",
          "This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests",
          "Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning",
          "Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains",
          "Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates",
          "One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine",
          "In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence",
          "More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether",
          "It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien",
          "Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience",
          "Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis",
          "At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior",
          "From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool",
          "However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered",
          "Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments",
          "To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration",
          "In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse"

self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr\", \"Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg\", \"In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter\", \"After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that

daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box\", \"Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure\", \"Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired

procedure Rossi and Reid published report of morphine<br>CPP in which the duration of time spent in morphine paired<br>context relative to saline paired context was used as the<br>index of preference\", \"To date the general procedure described by Rossi and Reid<br>has been adopted for essentially all subsequent CPP studies<br>with some modifications\", \"Although methodological details differ among laboratories<br>typical CPP experiment includes differentially pairing two<br>distinct sets of environmental contextual cues with the<br>stimulus of interest e.g drug food copulatory

access to natural appetitive stimuli like food<br>Spyraki water \\u00c5gmo sweet fluids conspecific interaction<br>wheel running Antoniadis copulation Meisel and novel stimuli<br>can condition

prefer<br>context previously paired with water\", \"Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see\", \"Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process\", \"An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement\", \"Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership\", \"The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool\", \"The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward\", \"logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward\", \"This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training\", \"Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes\", \"On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered\", \"see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species\", \"Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and self<br>administration\", \"In contrast neither CPP nor self administration is produced<br>by host of other drug classes including antagonists for<br>dopamine opioid and cholinergic receptors as well as<br>antidepressants that work on either noradrenergic or<br>serotonergic systems\", \"Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes\", \"Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine\", \"Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process\", \"Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose\", \"In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration\", \"In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats\", \"Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated\", \"In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue\", \"Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained\", \"These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes\", \"There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable\", \"Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats\", \"In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker\", \"This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips\", \"Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine\", \"Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine\", \"One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter\", \"This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal\", \"Recent evidence indicates that the ability of drugs to<br>activate the mesolimbic dopamine system is dependent at<br>least in part on whether the drug is administered passively<br>or is under operant control by the animal\", \"In general the increase in dopaminergic activity observed<br>with self administration of stimulant drugs is attenuated in<br>yoked control animals that receive the drug passively Di<br>Ciano Hemby Stefanski\", \"In contrast compared to self administration animals yoked<br>control animals show more pronounced dopaminergic response<br>in the nucleus accumbens following exposure to stimulus<br>previously paired with the amphetamine infusion Di Ciano\", \"Given these neurochemical differences in active and passive<br>administration groups it seems that the yoked control group<br>in drug self administration experiment rather than the self<br>administration group is the more appropriate comparison to<br>CPP.In conclusion there seems to be no reasonable argument<br>remaining to support the claim that CPP and<br>selfadministration are isomorphic measures of drug reward\", \"In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process\", \"Although the bulk of research supports this assumption what<br>is required for the acquisition of the conditioned<br>association between the context and the US\", \"For over years there has been much empirical and theoretical<br>effort spent on determining what factors are necessary for<br>acquisition and later expression of conditioned associations<br>between CSs and USs\", \"In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning\", \"That is the CS must occur close in time with the US\", \"In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the paired context\", \"Presumed early failures in contiguity theory however lead to<br>the competing theoretical position that information or<br>predictive and non redundant relation between the CS and US<br>was required for the acquisition of conditioned association\", \"In CPP experiments there tends to be perfect predictive<br>relation between the context CS and drug administration the<br>drug US and context CS always co occur\", \"Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory\", \"This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g\", \"For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS\", \"The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control\", \"However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g\", \"This conditioning results from accidental contiguous<br>pairings of the CS and US early in training even though<br>there is no overall predictive relation between the CS and<br>US\", \"Indeed to avoid such situations the most popular and widely<br>accepted control group in CPP is the explicitly unpaired<br>control group\", \"In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS\", \"Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment\", \"That is what becomes associated with the context CS\", \"Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf\", \"As argued earlier the CPP protocol provides measure of the<br>rewarding effect of the drug US similar to that postulated<br>by opponent process theories\", \"The rewarding effect has temporal profile that presumably<br>increases and then decreases across the time since<br>administration\", \"Consistent with this Ettenberg found that cocaine given<br>either immediately or min prior to placement into context<br>produced CPP whereas cocaine given min prior to placement<br>into context produced conditioned place aversion\", \"This latter finding indicates that the temporal effect of<br>cocaine is biphasic with an initial period of positive<br>effect followed by period of negative effect\", \"Thus the onset offset and subsequent opponent process of<br>drug elicited effects are in part function of the<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug under study\", \"As further layer of empirically and theoretically<br>interesting complexity the pharmacokinetics and<br>pharmacodynamics of drug can change with repeated exposures\", \"Some behavioral protocols allow one to readily measure the<br>temporal profile of the drug effect of interest\", \"Drug discrimination is good example where the temporal<br>profile of the discriminative stimulus cueing effects of<br>various abused drugs has been investigated\", \"e.g Jones\", \"Pratt In contrast little is known about the temporal profile<br>of the rewarding effects of many abused drugs\", \"The CPP protocol seems well suited to investigate the<br>temporal profile of reward and the necessary contiguous<br>relation between this profile and the context CS for<br>acquisition of conditioned association\", \"The limited literature attempting to elucidate the temporal<br>profile of drug reward in the CPP situation has employed two<br>main techniques behavioral and pharmacological manipulations\", \"report by exemplifies the use of both techniques to<br>elucidate some of the temporal qualities of the rewarding<br>effect of acute morphine\", \"In that study rats received single IV morphine infusion in<br>one distinct context second distinct context was equally<br>experienced but was not paired with drug before the<br>preference test\", \"One behavioral manipulation involved varying the temporal<br>arrangement between the CS and US\", \"This was accomplished by infusing morphine at different time<br>intervals or min following the onset of min placement into<br>the paired context\", \"CPP was observed when morphine was infused immediately upon<br>placement in the paired context\", \"However infusion of morphine either or min after exposure to<br>the CS abolished this place conditioning effect\", \"This technique provides some control of drug onset relative<br>to the CS and illustrates the importance of close temporal<br>proximity between context onset and reward onset in<br>establishing morphine CPP.The study by also utilized<br>pharmacological manipulation to examine the importance of<br>the temporal arrangement between the context CS and drug US<br>in producing morphine CPP\", \"This was accomplished by infusing the opioid receptor<br>antagonist naloxone to reverse the rewarding effect of<br>morphine at prescribed times\", \"Using the single trial CPP procedure described earlier<br>morphine was infused immediately upon placement in the<br>paired context and naloxone was administered either or min<br>afterward\", \"Naloxone treatment min after morphine did not block CPP\", \"In contrast naloxone treatment min after morphine completely<br>blocked CPP\", \"This technique provides control over the offset of the drug<br>US and suggests that more than min of the drug effect is<br>required to produce CPP\", \"It would also be possible to assess the temporal profile of<br>drug reward by holding the administration time constant<br>while manipulating total duration in the paired context\", \"Clearly much work is needed to elucidate the nature of the<br>rewarding effect and how its temporal profile changes with<br>such factors as drug type drug dose treatment regimen<br>continuous versus intermittent rearing environment and<br>stress exposure\", \"see Sherman Relevant to this discussion is the ability of<br>the CPP protocol to measure the postulated aversive effects<br>of drug withdrawal e.g Suzuki\", \"For example Suzuki found that rats avoided environmental<br>cues in which nicotine withdrawal had occurred i.e<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"Delineating the temporal characteristics of drug withdrawal<br>and the underlying neural process has important implications<br>for understanding drug abuse\", \"As mentioned previously CPP is indexed by an increase in<br>time spent in the drug paired context during preference test\", \"Presumably this measure reflects an increase in approach<br>responses to the context andor change in the type or<br>duration of behaviors once the paired context is encountered\", \"Unlike drug self administration where predetermined class of<br>responses e.g lever press is followed by an experimenter<br>programmed outcome i.e drug infusion there is no explicit<br>response requirement in the CPP protocol\", \"Drug is passively administered while the animal is in the<br>paired context\", \"This procedural feature begs the question of how behavior<br>change emerges from simply the close temporal pairing of the<br>context CS and the stimulus conditions reward in this case<br>induced by the drug\", \"Current thinking would argue that rats have evolutionarily<br>pre disposed response tendencies species specific responses<br>to stimuli that have aversive or rewarding qualities\", \"In CPP the context takes on secondary rewarding effect by<br>virtue of its contiguous pairing with drug\", \"Stimuli associated with rewarding effects like the paired<br>context in CPP elicit approach behaviors\", \"Of course an important task for researchers will be to break<br>the circularity of this argument by identifying the<br>underlying neural processes mediating the acquisition of<br>conditioned reward or aversion and to delineate the response<br>systems modulated by this conditioned reward\", \"Further it will be of interest to see the similarity and<br>differences in these processes and those that mediate cue<br>elicited relapse in self administration protocols Pilla<br>Neisewander\", \"In most CPP experiments the CS is complex multimodal<br>stimulus context including distinct olfactory visual tactile<br>auditory and spatial elements\", \"Does each stimulus element enter into an association with<br>the drug US or does the variety of elements combine to form<br>single configural stimulus

preference the question of how the context CS<br>is neurally coded has not been systematically addressed in<br>CPP experiments\", \"In contrast large portion of recent experimental and<br>theoretical effort in the Pavlovian conditioning field has<br>focused on distinguishing between elemental and configural<br>models of CS processing and learning\", \"Elemental theories suggest that each element that comprises<br>the paired context enters into its own association with the<br>US e.g Bevins\", \"The magnitude of the conditioned response is often assumed<br>to be the sum of all the conditioned elements present and<br>processed at the time of testing\", \"In contrast configural theories propose that stimulus<br>elements that comprise the context combine to form single<br>representation of the environment that would then enter into<br>the association with the US\", \"Configural theories often differ for example on how the<br>elements within the representation combine interact and<br>later induce conditioned responding depending on the stimuli<br>present during testing Rudy and Reilly\", \"For example Pearce suggests that if stimulus elements and<br>were present at the time of the US configural representation<br>AB would be formed and enter into the association with the<br>US\", \"Later presentation of the compound AB elicits strong<br>conditioned responding because of the direct association<br>with the US\", \"If only one element was presented e.g then conditioned<br>responding will be weaker in that is only portion of the<br>configural AB cue that was associated with the US\", \"In recent thought provoking review Fanselow argued that the<br>behavioral and neural evidence supports the presence of both<br>configural and elemental brain systems\", \"If so then an important task for researchers in the drug<br>conditioning field will be to distinguish between the<br>conditions that encourage elemental versus configural<br>processing of conditioned stimuli and to further delineate<br>the neuroanatomical and neurobiological processes mediating<br>each\", \"This is an important issue for studies with CPP that<br>typically use multimodal cues because the form

important issue for those interested in drug<br>reward mechanisms\", \"The extent to which CPP is observed expression may depend<br>differentially on how well the procedural details allow for<br>acquisition of context drug association in CXT and context<br>no drug association in CXTRelated to the previous discussion<br>is the possibility that CXT may be conditioned inhibitor e.g\", \"Typically for stimulus to become conditioned inhibitor that<br>stimulus must be presented in the presence of excitatory<br>stimuli i.e stimuli that have acquired an association with<br>the drug US

many of the procedural<br>details that are similar from day to day in CPP experiment<br>may enter into an association with the drug US thus<br>providing the prerequisite excitatory cues required to<br>produce conditioned inhibitor\", \"For example handling and transport procedures injection<br>ritual time of day location of apparatus and experimenter<br>tend to be consistent\", \"If these procedural details acquire an excitatory<br>association with the drug US then they may allow CXT to<br>become conditioned inhibitor when later presented on non<br>rewarded trials\", \"To our knowledge no one has assessed whether CXT in CPP<br>situation becomes conditioned inhibitor see for testing<br>protocols\", \"This possibility has important theoretical and empirical<br>implications\", \"Conditioned inhibitors have been shown in other Pavlovian<br>conditioning preparations to elicit avoidance responses e.g<br>Wasserman\", \"If CXT is an inhibitor research will need to

include approach to CXT as well as avoidance of CXTIn<br>this section we have not provided an exhaustive review of<br>all theoretical issues relevant to CPP\", \"For example recent and interesting theoretical view termed<br>the temporal coding hypothesis argues that acquisition of<br>conditioned association is dependent on contiguity between<br>the CS and US Barnet\", \"Automatically acquired as part of this association is when<br>the US occurs in relation to the CS i.e temporal coding\", \"Simply stated for the CPP protocol did the rewarding effect<br>occur before or after the context CS\", \"Also uncontrolled situational cues including the<br>interoceptive state of the organism at the time of<br>conditioning may also be an important part of what is<br>learned during CPP experiment\", \"There are clear biological changes in an organism over time\", \"As time passes these stimuli also change thus altering<br>expression of conditioning Bouton for differing view see<br>Riccio\", \"In comprehensive review Carr indicated that the major<br>advantages of CPP are that it is sensitive to low drug doses<br>can be obtained using only single drug pairing measures both<br>reward and aversion is tested when the animal is in drug<br>free state does not require surgical procedure and controls<br>for drug dosing\", \"Among these advantages the ability of CPP to measure drug<br>reward using single contextdrug US pairing is perhaps the<br>most unique advantage\", \"With drug self administration repeated self infusions of<br>drug are required in order to establish reliable behavior<br>and this repeated exposure protocol likely affects receptor<br>transduction mechanisms related to tolerance andor<br>sensitization\", \"In contrast single trial CPP has been demonstrated with<br>morphine Mucha cocaine and amphetamine This procedural<br>advantage allows for determining drug reward without any<br>induction of tolerance or sensitization\", \"Such information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen\", \"In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention\", \"One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward\", \"This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation\", \"Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas\", \"With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system\", \"Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure\", \"Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine\", \"Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats\", \"For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes\", \"Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP\", \"This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity\", \"Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu\", \"Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual\", \"Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice\", \"This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects\", \"One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward\", \"CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL\", \"The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest\", \"CPP allows for such rapid screening\", \"Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve\", \"This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford\", \"Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward\", \"Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose\", \"That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded\", \"Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo\", \"In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context\", \"More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs\", \"Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward\", \"For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion\", \"Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day\", \"It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context\", \"Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day\", \"While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking\", \"Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired\", \"When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation\", \"Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning\", \"An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context\", \"That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state\", \"While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel\", \"However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted\", \"In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning\", \"In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology\", \"Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals\", \"This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested\", \"Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses\", \"This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve\", \"Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive\", \"Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs\", \"strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference\", \"Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context\", \"This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests\", \"Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning\", \"Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains\", \"Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates\", \"One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine\", \"In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence\", \"More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether\", \"It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien\", \"Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience\", \"Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis\", \"At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior\", \"From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool\", \"However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered\", \"Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments\", \"To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration\", \"In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse\"], \"type\": \"bar\", \"x\": [0, 1,

          "The purpose of this review is to provide an evaluation of<br>conditioned place preference CPP as an experimental protocol<br>for measuring drug reward in laboratory animals",
          "We have chosen to refer to CPP as protocol for measuring<br>drug reward rather than reinforcement in order to<br>distinguish it from the drug self administration protocol",
          "Reinforcement is typically defined as any experimental<br>contingency operant or Pavlovian that increases the<br>probability of class of behaviors whereas reward typically<br>refers to the appetitive nature of given stimulus",
          "Since it is not clear what class of behaviors are reinforced<br>during CPP conditioning trials the term reward seems more<br>appropriate to describe drug induced CPP",
          "As an experimental protocol for measuring drug reward we<br>will provide an overview of the critical theoretical issues<br>relevant to this protocol especially as it relates to the<br>selfadministration protocol",
          "In addition we will provide critical summary of the<br>advantages and limitations of the protocol",
          "That is when should CPP be used and when should it not be<br>used",
          "Each of these issues is addressed using question and answer<br>format",
          "We have not attempted to provide comprehensive or<br>bibliographic compilation of all available CPP studies in<br>answering the posed questions as number of comprehensive<br>reviews of the CPP literature are already available Carr<br>Bardo",
          "CPP has become popular alternative to drug self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr",
          "Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg",
          "In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter",
          "After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that hid syringe filled<br>with their daily dose of morphine and black box that hid<br>banana",

          "The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool",

          "logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward",
          "This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training",
          "Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes",

          "In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration",
          "In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats",

          "For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS",

          "Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment",
          "That is what becomes associated with the context CS",
          "Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf",

          "This procedural feature begs the question of how behavior<br>change emerges from simply the close temporal pairing of the<br>context CS and the stimulus conditions reward in this case<br>induced by the drug",

          "In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention",
          "One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward",
          "This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation",
          "Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas",
          "With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system",
          "Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure",
          "Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine",
          "Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats",
          "For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes",
          "Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP",
          "This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity",

          "Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual",
          "Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice",
          "This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects",
          "One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward",
          "CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL",
          "The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest",
          "CPP allows for such rapid screening",
          "Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve",
          "This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford",
          "Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward",
          "Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose",
          "That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded",
          "Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo",
          "In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context",
          "More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs",
          "Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward",
          "For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion",
          "Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion",
          "One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day",
          "It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context",
          "Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day",
          "While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking",
          "Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired",
          "When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation",
          "Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning",
          "An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context",
          "That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state",
          "While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel",
          "However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted",
          "In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning",
          "In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology",
          "Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals",
          "This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested",
          "Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses",
          "This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve",
          "Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive",
          "Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs",
          "strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference",
          "Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context",
          "This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests",
          "Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning",
          "Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains",
          "Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates",
          "One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine",
          "In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence",
          "More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether",
          "It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien",
          "Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience",
          "Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis",
          "At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior",
          "From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool",
          "However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered",
          "Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments",
          "To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration",
          "In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse"

be<br>used\", \"Each of these issues is addressed using question and answer<br>format\", \"We have not attempted to provide comprehensive or<br>bibliographic compilation of all available CPP studies

self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr\", \"Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg\", \"In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter\", \"After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that hid syringe filled<br>with their daily dose of morphine and black box that hid<br>banana\", \"When deprived of morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the<br>white box but when pretreated with their daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box\", \"Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure\", \"Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired black arm in non dependent<br>rats indicating that the induction of physical dependence is<br>not prerequisite for obtaining CPP\", \"Following this demonstration of CPP using discrete trial<br>choice procedure Rossi and Reid published report of morphine<br>CPP in which the duration of time spent in morphine paired<br>context relative to saline paired context was used as the<br>index of preference\", \"To date the general procedure described by Rossi and Reid<br>has been adopted for essentially all subsequent CPP studies<br>with some modifications\", \"Although methodological details differ among laboratories<br>typical CPP experiment includes differentially pairing two<br>distinct sets of environmental contextual cues with the<br>stimulus of interest e.g drug food copulatory opportunity\", \"The contextual cues tend to differ along several stimulus<br>dimensions\", \"For example the contexts may vary in flooring size or shape<br>wall color or pattern and olfactory cues\", \"Conditioning involves an animal receiving repeated access to<br>the appetitive stimulus termed unconditioned stimulus or US<br>in one context termed conditioned stimulus or CS\", \"Intermixed with these context US pairings is similar<br>exposure to the other context without the US.Following<br>conditioning is choice test in which animals receive<br>unrestricted exposure to both contexts in the absence of the<br>US\", \"An increase in time spent in the paired context relative to<br>control value is taken as evidence that the US was rewarding\", \"Presumably the learned association between the context CS<br>and the US results in animals spending more time in that<br>context\", \"Research has shown that wide array of stimuli can condition<br>an increase in preference\", \"For example access to natural appetitive stimuli like food<br>Spyraki water \\u00c5gmo sweet fluids conspecific interaction<br>wheel running Antoniadis copulation Meisel and novel stimuli<br>can condition preferences in rodents\", \"These preferences are subject to changes in motivational<br>state as food deprived rats will prefer context previously<br>paired with food whereas water deprived rats will prefer<br>context previously paired with water\", \"Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see\", \"Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process\", \"An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement\", \"Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership\", \"The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool\", \"The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward\", \"logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward\", \"This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training\", \"Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes\", \"On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered\", \"see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species\", \"Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and self<br>administration\", \"In contrast neither CPP nor self administration is produced<br>by host of other drug classes including antagonists for<br>dopamine opioid and cholinergic receptors as well as<br>antidepressants that work on either noradrenergic or<br>serotonergic systems\", \"Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes\", \"Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine\", \"Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process\", \"Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose\", \"In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration\", \"In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats\", \"Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated\", \"In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue\", \"Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained\", \"These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes\", \"There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable\", \"Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats\", \"In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker\", \"This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips\", \"Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine\", \"Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine\", \"One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter\", \"This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal\", \"Recent evidence indicates that the ability of drugs to<br>activate the mesolimbic dopamine system is dependent at<br>least in part on whether the drug is administered passively<br>or is under operant control by the animal\", \"In general the increase in dopaminergic activity observed<br>with self administration of stimulant drugs is attenuated in<br>yoked control animals that receive the drug passively Di<br>Ciano Hemby Stefanski\", \"In contrast compared to self administration animals yoked<br>control animals show more pronounced dopaminergic response<br>in the nucleus accumbens following exposure to stimulus<br>previously paired with the amphetamine infusion Di Ciano\", \"Given these neurochemical differences in active and passive<br>administration groups it seems that the yoked control group<br>in drug self administration experiment rather than the self<br>administration group is the more appropriate comparison to<br>CPP.In conclusion there seems to be no reasonable argument<br>remaining to support the claim that CPP and<br>selfadministration are isomorphic measures of drug reward\", \"In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process\", \"Although the bulk of research supports this assumption what<br>is required for the acquisition of the conditioned<br>association between the context and the US\", \"For over years there has been much empirical and theoretical<br>effort spent on determining what factors are necessary for<br>acquisition and later expression of conditioned associations<br>between CSs and USs\", \"In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning\", \"That is the CS must occur close in time with the US\", \"In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the

information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen\", \"In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention\", \"One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward\", \"This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation\", \"Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas\", \"With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system\", \"Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure\", \"Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine\", \"Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats\", \"For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes\", \"Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP\", \"This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity\", \"Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu\", \"Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual\", \"Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice\", \"This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects\", \"One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward\", \"CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL\", \"The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest\", \"CPP allows for such rapid screening\", \"Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve\", \"This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford\", \"Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward\", \"Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose\", \"That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded\", \"Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo\", \"In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context\", \"More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs\", \"Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward\", \"For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion\", \"Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day\", \"It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context\", \"Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day\", \"While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking\", \"Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired\", \"When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation\", \"Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning\", \"An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context\", \"That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state\", \"While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel\", \"However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted\", \"In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning\", \"In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology\", \"Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals\", \"This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested\", \"Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses\", \"This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve\", \"Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive\", \"Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs\", \"strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference\", \"Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context\", \"This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests\", \"Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning\", \"Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains\", \"Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates\", \"One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine\", \"In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence\", \"More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether\", \"It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien\", \"Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience\", \"Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis\", \"At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior\", \"From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool\", \"However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered\", \"Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments\", \"To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that

          "The purpose of this review is to provide an evaluation of<br>conditioned place preference CPP as an experimental protocol<br>for measuring drug reward in laboratory animals",
          "We have chosen to refer to CPP as protocol for measuring<br>drug reward rather than reinforcement in order to<br>distinguish it from the drug self administration protocol",
          "Reinforcement is typically defined as any experimental<br>contingency operant or Pavlovian that increases the<br>probability of class of behaviors whereas reward typically<br>refers to the appetitive nature of given stimulus",
          "Since it is not clear what class of behaviors are reinforced<br>during CPP conditioning trials the term reward seems more<br>appropriate to describe drug induced CPP",
          "As an experimental protocol for measuring drug reward we<br>will provide an overview of the critical theoretical issues<br>relevant to this protocol especially as it relates to the<br>selfadministration protocol",
          "In addition we will provide critical summary of the<br>advantages and limitations of the protocol",
          "That is when should CPP be used and when should it not be<br>used",
          "Each of these issues is addressed using question and answer<br>format",
          "We have not attempted to provide comprehensive or<br>bibliographic compilation of all available CPP studies in<br>answering the posed questions as number of comprehensive<br>reviews of the CPP literature are already available Carr<br>Bardo",
          "CPP has become popular alternative to drug self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr",
          "Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg",
          "In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter",
          "After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that hid syringe filled<br>with their daily dose of morphine and black box that hid<br>banana",
          "When deprived of morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the<br>white box but when pretreated with their daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box",
          "Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure",
          "Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired black arm in non dependent<br>rats indicating that the induction of physical dependence is<br>not prerequisite for obtaining CPP",
          "Following this demonstration of CPP using discrete trial<br>choice procedure Rossi and Reid published report of morphine<br>CPP in which the duration of time spent in morphine paired<br>context relative to saline paired context was used as the<br>index of preference",
          "To date the general procedure described by Rossi and Reid<br>has been adopted for essentially all subsequent CPP studies<br>with some modifications",
          "Although methodological details differ among laboratories<br>typical CPP experiment includes differentially pairing two<br>distinct sets of environmental contextual cues with the<br>stimulus of interest e.g drug food copulatory opportunity",
          "The contextual cues tend to differ along several stimulus<br>dimensions",
          "For example the contexts may vary in flooring size or shape<br>wall color or pattern and olfactory cues",
          "Conditioning involves an animal receiving repeated access to<br>the appetitive stimulus termed unconditioned stimulus or US<br>in one context termed conditioned stimulus or CS",
          "Intermixed with these context US pairings is similar<br>exposure to the other context without the US.Following<br>conditioning is choice test in which animals receive<br>unrestricted exposure to both contexts in the absence of the<br>US",
          "An increase in time spent in the paired context relative to<br>control value is taken as evidence that the US was rewarding",
          "Presumably the learned association between the context CS<br>and the US results in animals spending more time in that<br>context",
          "Research has shown that wide array of stimuli can condition<br>an increase in preference",
          "For example access to natural appetitive stimuli like food<br>Spyraki water Ågmo sweet fluids conspecific interaction<br>wheel running Antoniadis copulation Meisel and novel stimuli<br>can condition preferences in rodents",
          "These preferences are subject to changes in motivational<br>state as food deprived rats will prefer context previously<br>paired with food whereas water deprived rats will prefer<br>context previously paired with water",
          "Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see",
          "Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process",
          "An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement",
          "Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership",
          "The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool",
          "The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward",
          "logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward",
          "This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training",
          "Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes",
          "On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered",
          "see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species",
          "Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and self<br>administration",
          "In contrast neither CPP nor self administration is produced<br>by host of other drug classes including antagonists for<br>dopamine opioid and cholinergic receptors as well as<br>antidepressants that work on either noradrenergic or<br>serotonergic systems",
          "Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes",
          "Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine",
          "Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process",
          "Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose",
          "In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration",
          "In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats",
          "Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated",
          "In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue",
          "Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained",
          "These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes",
          "There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable",
          "Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats",
          "In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker",
          "This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips",
          "Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine",
          "Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine",
          "One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter",
          "This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal",
          "Recent evidence indicates that the ability of drugs to<br>activate the mesolimbic dopamine system is dependent at<br>least in part on whether the drug is administered passively<br>or is under operant control by the animal",
          "In general the increase in dopaminergic activity observed<br>with self administration of stimulant drugs is attenuated in<br>yoked control animals that receive the drug passively Di<br>Ciano Hemby Stefanski",
          "In contrast compared to self administration animals yoked<br>control animals show more pronounced dopaminergic response<br>in the nucleus accumbens following exposure to stimulus<br>previously paired with the amphetamine infusion Di Ciano",
          "Given these neurochemical differences in active and passive<br>administration groups it seems that the yoked control group<br>in drug self administration experiment rather than the self<br>administration group is the more appropriate comparison to<br>CPP.In conclusion there seems to be no reasonable argument<br>remaining to support the claim that CPP and<br>selfadministration are isomorphic measures of drug reward",
          "In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process",
          "Although the bulk of research supports this assumption what<br>is required for the acquisition of the conditioned<br>association between the context and the US",
          "For over years there has been much empirical and theoretical<br>effort spent on determining what factors are necessary for<br>acquisition and later expression of conditioned associations<br>between CSs and USs",
          "In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning",
          "That is the CS must occur close in time with the US",
          "In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the paired context",
          "Presumed early failures in contiguity theory however lead to<br>the competing theoretical position that information or<br>predictive and non redundant relation between the CS and US<br>was required for the acquisition of conditioned association",
          "In CPP experiments there tends to be perfect predictive<br>relation between the context CS and drug administration the<br>drug US and context CS always co occur",
          "Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory",
          "This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g",
          "For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS",
          "The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control",
          "However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g",
          "This conditioning results from accidental contiguous<br>pairings of the CS and US early in training even though<br>there is no overall predictive relation between the CS and<br>US",
          "Indeed to avoid such situations the most popular and widely<br>accepted control group in CPP is the explicitly unpaired<br>control group",
          "In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS",
          "Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment",
          "That is what becomes associated with the context CS",
          "Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf",
          "As argued earlier the CPP protocol provides measure of the<br>rewarding effect of the drug US similar to that postulated<br>by opponent process theories",
          "The rewarding effect has temporal profile that presumably<br>increases and then decreases across the time since<br>administration",
          "Consistent with this Ettenberg found that cocaine given<br>either immediately or min prior to placement into context<br>produced CPP whereas cocaine given min prior to placement<br>into context produced conditioned place aversion",
          "This latter finding indicates that the temporal effect of<br>cocaine is biphasic with an initial period of positive<br>effect followed by period of negative effect",
          "Thus the onset offset and subsequent opponent process of<br>drug elicited effects are in part function of the<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug under study",
          "As further layer of empirically and theoretically<br>interesting complexity the pharmacokinetics and<br>pharmacodynamics of drug can change with repeated exposures",
          "Some behavioral protocols allow one to readily measure the<br>temporal profile of the drug effect of interest",
          "Drug discrimination is good example where the temporal<br>profile of the discriminative stimulus cueing effects of<br>various abused drugs has been investigated",
          "e.g Jones",
          "Pratt In contrast little is known about the temporal profile<br>of the rewarding effects of many abused drugs",
          "The CPP protocol seems well suited to investigate the<br>temporal profile of reward and the necessary contiguous<br>relation between this profile and the context CS for<br>acquisition of conditioned association",
          "The limited literature attempting to elucidate the temporal<br>profile of drug reward in the CPP situation has employed two<br>main techniques behavioral and pharmacological manipulations",
          "report by exemplifies the use of both techniques to<br>elucidate some of the temporal qualities of the rewarding<br>effect of acute morphine",
          "In that study rats received single IV morphine infusion in<br>one distinct context second distinct context was equally<br>experienced but was not paired with drug before the<br>preference test",
          "One behavioral manipulation involved varying the temporal<br>arrangement between the CS and US",
          "This was accomplished by infusing morphine at different time<br>intervals or min following the onset of min placement into<br>the paired context",
          "CPP was observed when morphine was infused immediately upon<br>placement in the paired context",
          "However infusion of morphine either or min after exposure to<br>the CS abolished this place conditioning effect",
          "This technique provides some control of drug onset relative<br>to the CS and illustrates the importance of close temporal<br>proximity between context onset and reward onset in<br>establishing morphine CPP.The study by also utilized<br>pharmacological manipulation to examine the importance of<br>the temporal arrangement between the context CS and drug US<br>in producing morphine CPP",
          "This was accomplished by infusing the opioid receptor<br>antagonist naloxone to reverse the rewarding effect of<br>morphine at prescribed times",
          "Using the single trial CPP procedure described earlier<br>morphine was infused immediately upon placement in the<br>paired context and naloxone was administered either or min<br>afterward",
          "Naloxone treatment min after morphine did not block CPP",
          "In contrast naloxone treatment min after morphine completely<br>blocked CPP",
          "This technique provides control over the offset of the drug<br>US and suggests that more than min of the drug effect is<br>required to produce CPP",
          "It would also be possible to assess the temporal profile of<br>drug reward by holding the administration time constant<br>while manipulating total duration in the paired context",
          "Clearly much work is needed to elucidate the nature of the<br>rewarding effect and how its temporal profile changes with<br>such factors as drug type drug dose treatment regimen<br>continuous versus intermittent rearing environment and<br>stress exposure",
          "see Sherman Relevant to this discussion is the ability of<br>the CPP protocol to measure the postulated aversive effects<br>of drug withdrawal e.g Suzuki",
          "For example Suzuki found that rats avoided environmental<br>cues in which nicotine withdrawal had occurred i.e<br>conditioned place aversion",
          "Delineating the temporal characteristics of drug withdrawal<br>and the underlying neural process has important implications<br>for understanding drug abuse",
          "As mentioned previously CPP is indexed by an increase in<br>time spent in the drug paired context during preference test",
          "Presumably this measure reflects an increase in approach<br>responses to the context andor change in the type or<br>duration of behaviors once the paired context is encountered",
          "Unlike drug self administration where predetermined class of<br>responses e.g lever press is followed by an experimenter<br>programmed outcome i.e drug infusion there is no explicit<br>response requirement in the CPP protocol",
          "Drug is passively administered while the animal is in the<br>paired context",
          "This procedural feature begs the question of how behavior<br>change emerges from simply the close temporal pairing of the<br>context CS and the stimulus conditions reward in this case<br>induced by the drug",
          "Current thinking would argue that rats have evolutionarily<br>pre disposed response tendencies species specific responses<br>to stimuli that have aversive or rewarding qualities",
          "In CPP the context takes on secondary rewarding effect by<br>virtue of its contiguous pairing with drug",
          "Stimuli associated with rewarding effects like the paired<br>context in CPP elicit approach behaviors",
          "Of course an important task for researchers will be to break<br>the circularity of this argument by identifying the<br>underlying neural processes mediating the acquisition of<br>conditioned reward or aversion and to delineate the response<br>systems modulated by this conditioned reward",
          "Further it will be of interest to see the similarity and<br>differences in these processes and those that mediate cue<br>elicited relapse in self administration protocols Pilla<br>Neisewander",
          "In most CPP experiments the CS is complex multimodal<br>stimulus context including distinct olfactory visual tactile<br>auditory and spatial elements",
          "Does each stimulus element enter into an association with<br>the drug US or does the variety of elements combine to form<br>single configural stimulus that then enters into an<br>association with the US",
          "Although there is evidence in the CPP literature that single<br>element e.g different tactile stimuli from flooring can<br>control place preference the question of how the context CS<br>is neurally coded has not been systematically addressed in<br>CPP experiments",
          "In contrast large portion of recent experimental and<br>theoretical effort in the Pavlovian conditioning field has<br>focused on distinguishing between elemental and configural<br>models of CS processing and learning",
          "Elemental theories suggest that each element that comprises<br>the paired context enters into its own association with the<br>US e.g Bevins",
          "The magnitude of the conditioned response is often assumed<br>to be the sum of all the conditioned elements present and<br>processed at the time of testing",
          "In contrast configural theories propose that stimulus<br>elements that comprise the context combine to form single<br>representation of the environment that would then enter into<br>the association with the US",
          "Configural theories often differ for example on how the<br>elements within the representation combine interact and<br>later induce conditioned responding depending on the stimuli<br>present during testing Rudy and Reilly",
          "For example Pearce suggests that if stimulus elements and<br>were present at the time of the US configural representation<br>AB would be formed and enter into the association with the<br>US",
          "Later presentation of the compound AB elicits strong<br>conditioned responding because of the direct association<br>with the US",
          "If only one element was presented e.g then conditioned<br>responding will be weaker in that is only portion of the<br>configural AB cue that was associated with the US",
          "In recent thought provoking review Fanselow argued that the<br>behavioral and neural evidence supports the presence of both<br>configural and elemental brain systems",
          "If so then an important task for researchers in the drug<br>conditioning field will be to distinguish between the<br>conditions that encourage elemental versus configural<br>processing of conditioned stimuli and to further delineate<br>the neuroanatomical and neurobiological processes mediating<br>each",
          "This is an important issue for studies with CPP that<br>typically use multimodal cues because the form of drug<br>induced CR may vary as function of the type of CS used to<br>establish conditioning",
          "While our discussion has focused on the context CS paired<br>with the drug US CXT CPP experiments are typically<br>successive discrimination task in which animals also receive<br>equal exposure to second distinct context not paired with<br>the drug US CXT",
          "Does learning occur to CXT or does it remain neutral",
          "It is likely that the organism becomes familiar with CXT",
          "Environmental familiarity is form of learning in that<br>changes in behavior occur as result of experience with the<br>context and those changes require neural storage of the<br>stimulus elements that compose the context",
          "Familiarity can alter place preferences",
          "Rodents in general spend more time in novel than familiar<br>context Bardo",
          "Because animals receive equal exposure to both CXT and CXT<br>environmental familiarity appears to be equated in CPP<br>experiments",
          "However if the drug of interest interferes with<br>familiarization then place preferences may reflect the<br>tendency of rats to spend more time in novel environment CXT<br>rather than conditioned association between the context and<br>the rewarding effect of the drug see later for more detailed<br>discussion of this notion Some conditioning theories propose<br>that stimuli that occur in the absence of an experimenter<br>programmed US may be neurally represented as CS no US<br>associations e.g",
          "context no US association may interfere with subsequent<br>conditioning to that context",
          "Thus non rewarded pre exposure to contexts or pre<br>conditioning preference tests may interfere with subsequent<br>acquisition andor expression of context drug US association<br>Lubow",
          "In contrast it is not clear whether no US association to one<br>discrete context CXT can interact with drug US association<br>in another context so as to alter choice behavior during<br>preference test",
          "This is an important issue for those interested in drug<br>reward mechanisms",
          "The extent to which CPP is observed expression may depend<br>differentially on how well the procedural details allow for<br>acquisition of context drug association in CXT and context<br>no drug association in CXTRelated to the previous discussion<br>is the possibility that CXT may be conditioned inhibitor e.g",
          "Typically for stimulus to become conditioned inhibitor that<br>stimulus must be presented in the presence of excitatory<br>stimuli i.e stimuli that have acquired an association with<br>the drug US yet not be followed by the US",
          "Clearly CXTis not followed by the US it is less clear<br>whether excitatory stimuli are present at the time of CXT<br>exposure",
          "strong case could be made that many of the procedural<br>details that are similar from day to day in CPP experiment<br>may enter into an association with the drug US thus<br>providing the prerequisite excitatory cues required to<br>produce conditioned inhibitor",
          "For example handling and transport procedures injection<br>ritual time of day location of apparatus and experimenter<br>tend to be consistent",
          "If these procedural details acquire an excitatory<br>association with the drug US then they may allow CXT to<br>become conditioned inhibitor when later presented on non<br>rewarded trials",
          "To our knowledge no one has assessed whether CXT in CPP<br>situation becomes conditioned inhibitor see for testing<br>protocols",
          "This possibility has important theoretical and empirical<br>implications",
          "Conditioned inhibitors have been shown in other Pavlovian<br>conditioning preparations to elicit avoidance responses e.g<br>Wasserman",
          "If CXT is an inhibitor research will need to determine<br>whether CXTelicits avoidance responses that contribute to<br>the increase in time spent in the drug paired context",
          "That is the measure of drug reward increased time in CXT<br>might include approach to CXT as well as avoidance of CXTIn<br>this section we have not provided an exhaustive review of<br>all theoretical issues relevant to CPP",
          "For example recent and interesting theoretical view termed<br>the temporal coding hypothesis argues that acquisition of<br>conditioned association is dependent on contiguity between<br>the CS and US Barnet",
          "Automatically acquired as part of this association is when<br>the US occurs in relation to the CS i.e temporal coding",
          "Simply stated for the CPP protocol did the rewarding effect<br>occur before or after the context CS",
          "Also uncontrolled situational cues including the<br>interoceptive state of the organism at the time of<br>conditioning may also be an important part of what is<br>learned during CPP experiment",
          "There are clear biological changes in an organism over time",
          "As time passes these stimuli also change thus altering<br>expression of conditioning Bouton for differing view see<br>Riccio",
          "In comprehensive review Carr indicated that the major<br>advantages of CPP are that it is sensitive to low drug doses<br>can be obtained using only single drug pairing measures both<br>reward and aversion is tested when the animal is in drug<br>free state does not require surgical procedure and controls<br>for drug dosing",
          "Among these advantages the ability of CPP to measure drug<br>reward using single contextdrug US pairing is perhaps the<br>most unique advantage",
          "With drug self administration repeated self infusions of<br>drug are required in order to establish reliable behavior<br>and this repeated exposure protocol likely affects receptor<br>transduction mechanisms related to tolerance andor<br>sensitization",
          "In contrast single trial CPP has been demonstrated with<br>morphine Mucha cocaine and amphetamine This procedural<br>advantage allows for determining drug reward without any<br>induction of tolerance or sensitization",
          "Such information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen",
          "In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention",
          "One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward",
          "This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation",
          "Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas",
          "With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system",
          "Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure",
          "Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine",
          "Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats",
          "For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes",
          "Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP",
          "This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity",
          "Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu",
          "Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual",
          "Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice",
          "This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects",
          "One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward",
          "CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL",
          "The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest",
          "CPP allows for such rapid screening",
          "Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve",
          "This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford",
          "Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward",
          "Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose",
          "That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded",
          "Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo",
          "In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context",
          "More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs",
          "Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward",
          "For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion",
          "Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion",
          "One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day",
          "It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context",
          "Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day",
          "While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking",
          "Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired",
          "When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation",
          "Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning",
          "An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context",
          "That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state",
          "While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel",
          "However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted",
          "In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning",
          "In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology",
          "Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals",
          "This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested",
          "Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses",
          "This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve",
          "Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive",
          "Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs",
          "strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference",
          "Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context",
          "This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests",
          "Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning",
          "Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains",
          "Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates",
          "One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine",
          "In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence",
          "More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether",
          "It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien",
          "Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience",
          "Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis",
          "At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior",
          "From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool",
          "However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered",
          "Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments",
          "To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration",
          "In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse"

theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation\", \"Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas\", \"With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system\", \"Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure\", \"Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine\", \"Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats\", \"For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes\", \"Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP\", \"This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity\", \"Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting

tactile<br>olfactory to the individual\", \"Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice\", \"This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects\", \"One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward\", \"CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL\", \"The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest\", \"CPP allows for such rapid screening\", \"Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve\", \"This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford\", \"Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more

in drug dose\", \"That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded\", \"Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo\", \"In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context\", \"More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs\", \"Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward\", \"For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion\", \"Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day\", \"It is well established that rats

noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking\", \"Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired\", \"When tested in

is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning\", \"An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context\", \"That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state\", \"While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel\", \"However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted\", \"In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning\", \"In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology\", \"Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals\", \"This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested\", \"Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses\", \"This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve\", \"Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive\", \"Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs\", \"strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference\", \"Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context\", \"This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests\", \"Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning\", \"Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains\", \"Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates\", \"One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine\", \"In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence\", \"More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether\", \"It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien\", \"Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience\", \"Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis\", \"At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior\", \"From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool\", \"However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered\", \"Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments\", \"To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration\", \"In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse\"], \"type\": \"bar\", \"x\": [0, 1,

          "The purpose of this review is to provide an evaluation of<br>conditioned place preference CPP as an experimental protocol<br>for measuring drug reward in laboratory animals",
          "We have chosen to refer to CPP as protocol for measuring<br>drug reward rather than reinforcement in order to<br>distinguish it from the drug self administration protocol",
          "Reinforcement is typically defined as any experimental<br>contingency operant or Pavlovian that increases the<br>probability of class of behaviors whereas reward typically<br>refers to the appetitive nature of given stimulus",
          "Since it is not clear what class of behaviors are reinforced<br>during CPP conditioning trials the term reward seems more<br>appropriate to describe drug induced CPP",
          "As an experimental protocol for measuring drug reward we<br>will provide an overview of the critical theoretical issues<br>relevant to this protocol especially as it relates to the<br>selfadministration protocol",
          "In addition we will provide critical summary of the<br>advantages and limitations of the protocol",
          "That is when should CPP be used and when should it not be<br>used",
          "Each of these issues is addressed using question and answer<br>format",
          "We have not attempted to provide comprehensive or<br>bibliographic compilation of all available CPP studies in<br>answering the posed questions as number of comprehensive<br>reviews of the CPP literature are already available Carr<br>Bardo",
          "CPP has become popular alternative to drug self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr",
          "Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg",
          "In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter",
          "After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that hid syringe filled<br>with their daily dose of morphine and black box that hid<br>banana",
          "When deprived of morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the<br>white box but when pretreated with their daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box",
          "Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure",
          "Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired black arm in non dependent<br>rats indicating that the induction of physical dependence is<br>not prerequisite for obtaining CPP",
          "Following this demonstration of CPP using discrete trial<br>choice procedure Rossi and Reid published report of morphine<br>CPP in which the duration of time spent in morphine paired<br>context relative to saline paired context was used as the<br>index of preference",
          "To date the general procedure described by Rossi and Reid<br>has been adopted for essentially all subsequent CPP studies<br>with some modifications",
          "Although methodological details differ among laboratories<br>typical CPP experiment includes differentially pairing two<br>distinct sets of environmental contextual cues with the<br>stimulus of interest e.g drug food copulatory opportunity",
          "The contextual cues tend to differ along several stimulus<br>dimensions",
          "For example the contexts may vary in flooring size or shape<br>wall color or pattern and olfactory cues",
          "Conditioning involves an animal receiving repeated access to<br>the appetitive stimulus termed unconditioned stimulus or US<br>in one context termed conditioned stimulus or CS",
          "Intermixed with these context US pairings is similar<br>exposure to the other context without the US.Following<br>conditioning is choice test in which animals receive<br>unrestricted exposure to both contexts in the absence of the<br>US",
          "An increase in time spent in the paired context relative to<br>control value is taken as evidence that the US was rewarding",
          "Presumably the learned association between the context CS<br>and the US results in animals spending more time in that<br>context",
          "Research has shown that wide array of stimuli can condition<br>an increase in preference",
          "For example access to natural appetitive stimuli like food<br>Spyraki water Ågmo sweet fluids conspecific interaction<br>wheel running Antoniadis copulation Meisel and novel stimuli<br>can condition preferences in rodents",
          "These preferences are subject to changes in motivational<br>state as food deprived rats will prefer context previously<br>paired with food whereas water deprived rats will prefer<br>context previously paired with water",
          "Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see",
          "Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process",
          "An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement",
          "Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership",
          "The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool",
          "The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward",
          "logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward",
          "This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training",
          "Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes",
          "On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered",
          "see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species",
          "Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and self<br>administration",
          "In contrast neither CPP nor self administration is produced<br>by host of other drug classes including antagonists for<br>dopamine opioid and cholinergic receptors as well as<br>antidepressants that work on either noradrenergic or<br>serotonergic systems",
          "Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes",
          "Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine",
          "Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process",
          "Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose",
          "In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration",
          "In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats",
          "Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated",
          "In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue",
          "Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained",
          "These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes",
          "There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable",
          "Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats",
          "In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker",
          "This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips",
          "Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine",
          "Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine",
          "One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter",
          "This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal",
          "Recent evidence indicates that the ability of drugs to<br>activate the mesolimbic dopamine system is dependent at<br>least in part on whether the drug is administered passively<br>or is under operant control by the animal",
          "In general the increase in dopaminergic activity observed<br>with self administration of stimulant drugs is attenuated in<br>yoked control animals that receive the drug passively Di<br>Ciano Hemby Stefanski",
          "In contrast compared to self administration animals yoked<br>control animals show more pronounced dopaminergic response<br>in the nucleus accumbens following exposure to stimulus<br>previously paired with the amphetamine infusion Di Ciano",
          "Given these neurochemical differences in active and passive<br>administration groups it seems that the yoked control group<br>in drug self administration experiment rather than the self<br>administration group is the more appropriate comparison to<br>CPP.In conclusion there seems to be no reasonable argument<br>remaining to support the claim that CPP and<br>selfadministration are isomorphic measures of drug reward",
          "In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process",
          "Although the bulk of research supports this assumption what<br>is required for the acquisition of the conditioned<br>association between the context and the US",
          "For over years there has been much empirical and theoretical<br>effort spent on determining what factors are necessary for<br>acquisition and later expression of conditioned associations<br>between CSs and USs",
          "In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning",
          "That is the CS must occur close in time with the US",
          "In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the paired context",
          "Presumed early failures in contiguity theory however lead to<br>the competing theoretical position that information or<br>predictive and non redundant relation between the CS and US<br>was required for the acquisition of conditioned association",
          "In CPP experiments there tends to be perfect predictive<br>relation between the context CS and drug administration the<br>drug US and context CS always co occur",
          "Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory",
          "This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g",
          "For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS",
          "The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control",
          "However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g",
          "This conditioning results from accidental contiguous<br>pairings of the CS and US early in training even though<br>there is no overall predictive relation between the CS and<br>US",
          "Indeed to avoid such situations the most popular and widely<br>accepted control group in CPP is the explicitly unpaired<br>control group",
          "In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS",
          "Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment",
          "That is what becomes associated with the context CS",
          "Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf",
          "As argued earlier the CPP protocol provides measure of the<br>rewarding effect of the drug US similar to that postulated<br>by opponent process theories",
          "The rewarding effect has temporal profile that presumably<br>increases and then decreases across the time since<br>administration",
          "Consistent with this Ettenberg found that cocaine given<br>either immediately or min prior to placement into context<br>produced CPP whereas cocaine given min prior to placement<br>into context produced conditioned place aversion",
          "This latter finding indicates that the temporal effect of<br>cocaine is biphasic with an initial period of positive<br>effect followed by period of negative effect",
          "Thus the onset offset and subsequent opponent process of<br>drug elicited effects are in part function of the<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug under study",
          "As further layer of empirically and theoretically<br>interesting complexity the pharmacokinetics and<br>pharmacodynamics of drug can change with repeated exposures",
          "Some behavioral protocols allow one to readily measure the<br>temporal profile of the drug effect of interest",

          "This was accomplished by infusing the opioid receptor<br>antagonist naloxone to reverse the rewarding effect of<br>morphine at prescribed times",

          "As mentioned previously CPP is indexed by an increase in<br>time spent in the drug paired context during preference test",
          "Presumably this measure reflects an increase in approach<br>responses to the context andor change in the type or<br>duration of behaviors once the paired context is encountered",
          "Unlike drug self administration where predetermined class of<br>responses e.g lever press is followed by an experimenter<br>programmed outcome i.e drug infusion there is no explicit<br>response requirement in the CPP protocol",
          "Drug is passively administered while the animal is in the<br>paired context",
          "This procedural feature begs the question of how behavior<br>change emerges from simply the close temporal pairing of the<br>context CS and the stimulus conditions reward in this case<br>induced by the drug",

          "In CPP the context takes on secondary rewarding effect by<br>virtue of its contiguous pairing with drug",
          "Stimuli associated with rewarding effects like the paired<br>context in CPP elicit approach behaviors",
          "Of course an important task for researchers will be to break<br>the circularity of this argument by identifying the<br>underlying neural processes mediating the acquisition of<br>conditioned reward or aversion and to delineate the response<br>systems modulated by this conditioned reward",

          "This is an important issue for studies with CPP that<br>typically use multimodal cues because the form of drug<br>induced CR may vary as function of the type of CS used to<br>establish conditioning",
          "While our discussion has focused on the context CS paired<br>with the drug US CXT CPP experiments are typically<br>successive discrimination task in which animals also receive<br>equal exposure to second distinct context not paired with<br>the drug US CXT",
          "Does learning occur to CXT or does it remain neutral",
          "It is likely that the organism becomes familiar with CXT",
          "Environmental familiarity is form of learning in that<br>changes in behavior occur as result of experience with the<br>context and those changes require neural storage of the<br>stimulus elements that compose the context",

          "If these procedural details acquire an excitatory<br>association with the drug US then they may allow CXT to<br>become conditioned inhibitor when later presented on non<br>rewarded trials",
          "To our knowledge no one has assessed whether CXT in CPP<br>situation becomes conditioned inhibitor see for testing<br>protocols",
          "This possibility has important theoretical and empirical<br>implications",
          "Conditioned inhibitors have been shown in other Pavlovian<br>conditioning preparations to elicit avoidance responses e.g<br>Wasserman",

          "That is the measure of drug reward increased time in CXT<br>might include approach to CXT as well as avoidance of CXTIn<br>this section we have not provided an exhaustive review of<br>all theoretical issues relevant to CPP",
          "For example recent and interesting theoretical view termed<br>the temporal coding hypothesis argues that acquisition of<br>conditioned association is dependent on contiguity between<br>the CS and US Barnet",
          "Automatically acquired as part of this association is when<br>the US occurs in relation to the CS i.e temporal coding",
          "Simply stated for the CPP protocol did the rewarding effect<br>occur before or after the context CS",
          "Also uncontrolled situational cues including the<br>interoceptive state of the organism at the time of<br>conditioning may also be an important part of what is<br>learned during CPP experiment",
          "There are clear biological changes in an organism over time",
          "As time passes these stimuli also change thus altering<br>expression of conditioning Bouton for differing view see<br>Riccio",
          "In comprehensive review Carr indicated that the major<br>advantages of CPP are that it is sensitive to low drug doses<br>can be obtained using only single drug pairing measures both<br>reward and aversion is tested when the animal is in drug<br>free state does not require surgical procedure and controls<br>for drug dosing",
          "Among these advantages the ability of CPP to measure drug<br>reward using single contextdrug US pairing is perhaps the<br>most unique advantage",
          "With drug self administration repeated self infusions of<br>drug are required in order to establish reliable behavior<br>and this repeated exposure protocol likely affects receptor<br>transduction mechanisms related to tolerance andor<br>sensitization",
          "In contrast single trial CPP has been demonstrated with<br>morphine Mucha cocaine and amphetamine This procedural<br>advantage allows for determining drug reward without any<br>induction of tolerance or sensitization",
          "Such information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen",
          "In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention",
          "One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward",
          "This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation",
          "Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas",
          "With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system",
          "Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure",
          "Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine",
          "Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats",
          "For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes",
          "Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP",
          "This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity",
          "Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu",
          "Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual",
          "Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice",
          "This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects",
          "One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward",
          "CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL",
          "The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest",
          "CPP allows for such rapid screening",
          "Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve",
          "This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford",
          "Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward",
          "Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose",
          "That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded",
          "Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo",
          "In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context",
          "More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs",
          "Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward",
          "For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion",
          "Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion",
          "One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day",
          "It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context",
          "Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day",
          "While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking",
          "Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired",
          "When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation",
          "Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning",
          "An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context",
          "That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state",
          "While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel",
          "However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted",
          "In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning",
          "In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology",
          "Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals",
          "This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested",
          "Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses",
          "This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve",
          "Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive",
          "Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs",
          "strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference",
          "Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context",
          "This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests",
          "Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning",
          "Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains",
          "Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates",
          "One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine",
          "In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence",
          "More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether",
          "It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien",
          "Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience",
          "Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis",
          "At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior",
          "From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool",
          "However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered",
          "Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments",
          "To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration",
          "In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse"

daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box\", \"Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure\", \"Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired

prefer<br>context previously paired with water\", \"Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see\", \"Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process\", \"An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement\", \"Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership\", \"The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool\", \"The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward\", \"logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward\", \"This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training\", \"Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes\", \"On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered\", \"see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species\", \"Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and

and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process\", \"Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose\", \"In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration\", \"In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats\", \"Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated\", \"In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue\", \"Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained\", \"These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes\", \"There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable\", \"Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats\", \"In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker\", \"This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips\", \"Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine\", \"Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine\", \"One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter\", \"This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal\", \"Recent evidence indicates that the ability of drugs to<br>activate the mesolimbic dopamine system is dependent at<br>least in part on whether the drug is administered passively<br>or is under operant control by the animal\", \"In general the increase in dopaminergic activity observed<br>with self administration of stimulant drugs is attenuated in<br>yoked control animals that receive the drug passively Di<br>Ciano Hemby Stefanski\", \"In contrast compared to self administration animals yoked<br>control animals show more pronounced dopaminergic response<br>in the nucleus accumbens following exposure to stimulus<br>previously paired with the amphetamine infusion Di Ciano\", \"Given these neurochemical differences in active and passive<br>administration groups it seems that the yoked control group<br>in drug self administration experiment rather than the self<br>administration group is the more appropriate comparison to<br>CPP.In conclusion there seems to be no reasonable argument<br>remaining to support the claim that CPP and<br>selfadministration are isomorphic measures of drug reward\", \"In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process\", \"Although the bulk of research supports this assumption what<br>is required for the acquisition of the conditioned<br>association between the context and the US\", \"For over years there has been much empirical and theoretical<br>effort spent on determining what factors are necessary for<br>acquisition and later expression of conditioned associations<br>between CSs and USs\", \"In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning\", \"That is the CS must occur close in time with the US\", \"In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the paired context\", \"Presumed early failures in contiguity theory however lead to<br>the competing theoretical position that information or<br>predictive and non redundant relation between the CS and US<br>was required for the acquisition of conditioned association\", \"In CPP experiments there tends to be perfect predictive<br>relation between the context CS and drug administration the<br>drug US and context CS always co occur\", \"Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory\", \"This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g\", \"For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS\", \"The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control\", \"However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g\", \"This conditioning results from accidental contiguous<br>pairings of the CS and US early in training even though<br>there is no overall predictive relation between the CS and<br>US\", \"Indeed to avoid such situations the most popular and widely<br>accepted control group in CPP is the explicitly unpaired<br>control group\", \"In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS\", \"Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment\", \"That is what becomes associated with the context CS\", \"Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf\", \"As argued earlier the CPP protocol provides measure of the<br>rewarding effect of the drug US similar to that postulated<br>by opponent process theories\", \"The rewarding effect has temporal profile that presumably<br>increases and then decreases across the time since<br>administration\", \"Consistent with this Ettenberg found that cocaine given<br>either immediately or min prior to placement into context<br>produced CPP whereas cocaine given min prior to placement<br>into context produced conditioned place aversion\", \"This latter finding indicates that the temporal effect of<br>cocaine is biphasic with an initial period of positive<br>effect followed by period of negative effect\", \"Thus the onset offset and subsequent opponent process of<br>drug elicited effects are in part function of the<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug under study\", \"As further layer of empirically and theoretically<br>interesting complexity the pharmacokinetics and<br>pharmacodynamics of drug can change with repeated exposures\", \"Some behavioral protocols allow one to readily measure the<br>temporal profile of the drug effect of interest\", \"Drug discrimination is good example where the temporal<br>profile of the discriminative stimulus cueing effects of<br>various abused drugs has been investigated\", \"e.g Jones\", \"Pratt In contrast little is known about the temporal profile<br>of the rewarding effects of many abused drugs\", \"The CPP protocol seems well suited to investigate the<br>temporal profile of reward and the necessary contiguous<br>relation between this profile and the context CS for<br>acquisition of conditioned association\", \"The limited literature attempting to elucidate the temporal<br>profile of drug reward in the CPP situation has employed two<br>main techniques behavioral and pharmacological manipulations\", \"report by exemplifies the use of both techniques to<br>elucidate some of the temporal qualities of the rewarding<br>effect of acute morphine\", \"In that study rats received single IV morphine infusion in<br>one distinct context second distinct context was equally<br>experienced but was not paired with drug before the<br>preference test\", \"One behavioral manipulation involved varying the temporal<br>arrangement between the CS and US\", \"This was accomplished by infusing morphine at different time<br>intervals or min following the onset of min placement into<br>the paired context\", \"CPP was observed when morphine was infused immediately upon<br>placement in the paired context\", \"However infusion of morphine either or min after exposure to<br>the CS abolished this place conditioning effect\", \"This technique provides some control of drug onset relative<br>to the CS and illustrates the importance of close temporal<br>proximity between context onset and reward onset in<br>establishing morphine CPP.The study by also utilized<br>pharmacological manipulation to examine the importance of<br>the temporal arrangement between the context CS and drug US<br>in producing morphine CPP\", \"This was accomplished by infusing the opioid receptor<br>antagonist naloxone to reverse the rewarding effect of<br>morphine at prescribed times\", \"Using the single trial CPP procedure described earlier<br>morphine was infused immediately upon placement in the<br>paired context and naloxone was administered either or min<br>afterward\", \"Naloxone treatment min after morphine did not block CPP\", \"In contrast naloxone treatment min after morphine completely<br>blocked CPP\", \"This technique provides control over the offset of the drug<br>US and suggests that more than min of the drug effect is<br>required to produce CPP\", \"It would also be possible to assess the temporal profile of<br>drug reward by holding the administration time constant<br>while manipulating total duration in the paired context\", \"Clearly much work is needed to elucidate the nature of the<br>rewarding effect and how its temporal profile changes with<br>such factors as drug type drug dose treatment regimen<br>continuous versus intermittent rearing environment and<br>stress exposure\", \"see Sherman Relevant to this discussion is the ability of<br>the CPP protocol to measure the postulated aversive effects<br>of drug withdrawal e.g Suzuki\", \"For example Suzuki found that rats avoided environmental<br>cues in which nicotine withdrawal had occurred i.e<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"Delineating the temporal characteristics of drug withdrawal<br>and the underlying neural process has important implications<br>for understanding drug abuse\", \"As mentioned previously CPP is indexed by an increase in<br>time spent in the drug paired context during preference test\", \"Presumably this measure reflects an increase in approach<br>responses to the context andor change in the type or<br>duration of behaviors once the paired context is encountered\", \"Unlike drug self administration where predetermined class of<br>responses e.g lever press is followed by an experimenter<br>programmed outcome i.e drug infusion there is no explicit<br>response requirement in the CPP protocol\", \"Drug is passively administered while the animal is in the<br>paired context\", \"This procedural feature begs the question of how behavior<br>change emerges from simply the close temporal pairing of the<br>context CS and the stimulus conditions reward in this case<br>induced by the drug\", \"Current thinking would argue that rats have evolutionarily<br>pre disposed response tendencies species specific responses<br>to stimuli that have aversive or rewarding qualities\", \"In CPP the context takes on secondary rewarding effect by<br>virtue of its contiguous pairing with drug\", \"Stimuli associated with rewarding effects like the paired<br>context in CPP elicit approach behaviors\", \"Of course an important task for researchers will be to break<br>the circularity of this argument by identifying the<br>underlying neural processes mediating the acquisition of<br>conditioned reward or aversion and to delineate the response<br>systems modulated by this conditioned reward\", \"Further it will be of interest to see the similarity and<br>differences in these processes and those that mediate

preference the question of how the context CS<br>is neurally coded has not been systematically addressed in<br>CPP experiments\", \"In contrast large portion of recent experimental and<br>theoretical effort in the Pavlovian conditioning field has<br>focused on distinguishing between elemental and configural<br>models of CS processing and learning\", \"Elemental theories suggest that each element that comprises<br>the paired context enters into its own association with the<br>US e.g Bevins\", \"The magnitude of the conditioned response is often assumed<br>to be the sum of all the conditioned elements present and<br>processed at the time of testing\", \"In contrast configural theories propose that stimulus<br>elements that comprise the context combine to form single<br>representation of the environment that would then enter into<br>the association with the US\", \"Configural theories often differ for example on how the<br>elements within the representation combine interact and<br>later induce conditioned responding depending on the stimuli<br>present during testing Rudy and Reilly\", \"For example Pearce suggests that if stimulus elements and<br>were present at the time of the US configural representation<br>AB would be formed and enter into the association with the<br>US\", \"Later presentation of the compound AB elicits strong<br>conditioned responding because of the direct association<br>with the US\", \"If only one element was presented e.g then conditioned<br>responding will be weaker in that is only portion of the<br>configural AB cue that was associated with the US\", \"In recent thought provoking review Fanselow argued that the<br>behavioral and neural evidence supports the presence of both<br>configural and elemental brain systems\", \"If so then an important task for researchers in the drug<br>conditioning field will be to distinguish between the<br>conditions that encourage elemental versus configural<br>processing of conditioned stimuli and to further delineate<br>the neuroanatomical and neurobiological processes mediating<br>each\", \"This is an important issue for studies with CPP that<br>typically use multimodal cues because the form of drug<br>induced CR may vary as function of the type of CS used to<br>establish conditioning\", \"While our discussion has focused on the context CS paired<br>with the drug US CXT CPP experiments are typically<br>successive discrimination task in which animals also receive<br>equal exposure to second distinct context not paired with<br>the drug US CXT\", \"Does learning occur to CXT or does it remain neutral\", \"It is likely that the organism becomes familiar with CXT\", \"Environmental familiarity is form of learning in that<br>changes in behavior occur as result of experience with the<br>context and those changes require neural storage of the<br>stimulus elements that compose the context\", \"Familiarity can alter place preferences\", \"Rodents in general spend more time in novel than familiar<br>context Bardo\", \"Because animals receive equal exposure to both CXT and CXT<br>environmental familiarity appears to be equated in CPP<br>experiments\", \"However if the drug of interest interferes with<br>familiarization then place preferences may reflect the<br>tendency of rats to spend more time in novel environment CXT<br>rather than conditioned association between the context and<br>the rewarding effect of the drug see later for more detailed<br>discussion of this notion Some conditioning theories propose<br>that stimuli that occur in the absence of an experimenter<br>programmed US may be neurally represented as CS no US<br>associations e.g\", \"context no US association may interfere with subsequent<br>conditioning to that context\", \"Thus non rewarded pre exposure to contexts or pre<br>conditioning preference tests may interfere with subsequent<br>acquisition andor expression of context drug US association<br>Lubow\", \"In contrast it is not clear whether no US association to one<br>discrete context CXT can interact with drug US association<br>in another context so as to alter choice behavior during<br>preference test\", \"This is an important issue for those interested in drug<br>reward mechanisms\", \"The extent to which CPP is observed expression may depend<br>differentially on how well the procedural details allow for<br>acquisition of context drug association in CXT and context<br>no drug association in CXTRelated to the previous discussion<br>is the possibility that CXT may be conditioned inhibitor e.g\", \"Typically for stimulus to become conditioned inhibitor that<br>stimulus must be presented in the presence of excitatory<br>stimuli i.e stimuli that have acquired an association with<br>the drug US

many of the procedural<br>details that are similar from day to day in CPP experiment<br>may enter into an association with the drug US thus<br>providing the prerequisite excitatory cues required to<br>produce conditioned inhibitor\", \"For example handling and transport procedures injection<br>ritual time of day location of apparatus and experimenter<br>tend to be consistent\", \"If these procedural details acquire an excitatory<br>association with the drug US then they may allow CXT to<br>become conditioned inhibitor when later presented on non<br>rewarded trials\", \"To our knowledge

experiment\", \"There are clear biological changes in an organism over time\", \"As time passes these stimuli also change thus altering<br>expression of conditioning Bouton for differing view see<br>Riccio\", \"In comprehensive review Carr indicated that the major<br>advantages of CPP are that it is sensitive to low drug doses<br>can be obtained using only single drug pairing measures both<br>reward and aversion is tested when the animal is in drug<br>free state does not require surgical procedure and controls<br>for drug dosing\", \"Among these advantages the ability of CPP to measure drug<br>reward using single contextdrug US pairing is perhaps the<br>most unique advantage\", \"With drug self administration repeated self infusions of<br>drug are required in order to establish reliable behavior<br>and this repeated exposure protocol likely affects receptor<br>transduction mechanisms related to tolerance andor<br>sensitization\", \"In contrast single trial CPP has been demonstrated with<br>morphine Mucha cocaine and amphetamine This procedural<br>advantage allows for determining drug reward without any<br>induction of tolerance or sensitization\", \"Such information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen\", \"In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention\", \"One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward\", \"This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation\", \"Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas\", \"With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system\", \"Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure\", \"Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine\", \"Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats\", \"For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes\", \"Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP\", \"This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity\", \"Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu\", \"Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual\", \"Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice\", \"This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects\", \"One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward\", \"CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL\", \"The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest\", \"CPP allows for such rapid screening\", \"Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve\", \"This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford\", \"Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward\", \"Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose\", \"That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded\", \"Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo\", \"In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context\", \"More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs\", \"Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward\", \"For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion\", \"Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day\", \"It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context\", \"Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day\", \"While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking\", \"Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired\", \"When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation\", \"Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning\", \"An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context\", \"That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state\", \"While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel\", \"However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted\", \"In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning\", \"In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology\", \"Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals\", \"This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested\", \"Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses\", \"This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve\", \"Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive\", \"Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs\", \"strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference\", \"Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context\", \"This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests\", \"Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning\", \"Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains\", \"Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates\", \"One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine\", \"In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence\", \"More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether\", \"It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien\", \"Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience\", \"Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis\", \"At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior\", \"From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool\", \"However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered\", \"Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments\", \"To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration\", \"In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse\"], \"type\": \"bar\", \"x\": [0, 1,

          "The purpose of this review is to provide an evaluation of<br>conditioned place preference CPP as an experimental protocol<br>for measuring drug reward in laboratory animals",
          "We have chosen to refer to CPP as protocol for measuring<br>drug reward rather than reinforcement in order to<br>distinguish it from the drug self administration protocol",
          "Reinforcement is typically defined as any experimental<br>contingency operant or Pavlovian that increases the<br>probability of class of behaviors whereas reward typically<br>refers to the appetitive nature of given stimulus",
          "Since it is not clear what class of behaviors are reinforced<br>during CPP conditioning trials the term reward seems more<br>appropriate to describe drug induced CPP",
          "As an experimental protocol for measuring drug reward we<br>will provide an overview of the critical theoretical issues<br>relevant to this protocol especially as it relates to the<br>selfadministration protocol",
          "In addition we will provide critical summary of the<br>advantages and limitations of the protocol",
          "That is when should CPP be used and when should it not be<br>used",
          "Each of these issues is addressed using question and answer<br>format",
          "We have not attempted to provide comprehensive or<br>bibliographic compilation of all available CPP studies in<br>answering the posed questions as number of comprehensive<br>reviews of the CPP literature are already available Carr<br>Bardo",
          "CPP has become popular alternative to drug self<br>administration for assessing the rewarding effects of vari<br>ety of drugs Carr",
          "Perhaps the earliest antecedent to the currently used CPP<br>procedure was study conducted by Spragg",
          "In that study chimpanzees were given daily injections of<br>morphine by an experimenter",
          "After becoming morphine dependent the chimpanzees were then<br>trained to choose between white box that hid syringe filled<br>with their daily dose of morphine and black box that hid<br>banana",
          "When deprived of morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the<br>white box but when pretreated with their daily dose of<br>morphine the chimpanzees chose to open the black box",
          "Based on this seminal work with chimpanzees Beach found that<br>morphine dependent rats could also be trained to choose the<br>white arm of maze when it was paired with morphine using<br>discrete trial choice procedure",
          "Importantly Beach also found that the morphinepaired white<br>arm was preferred to an unpaired black arm in non dependent<br>rats indicating that the induction of physical dependence is<br>not prerequisite for obtaining CPP",
          "Following this demonstration of CPP using discrete trial<br>choice procedure Rossi and Reid published report of morphine<br>CPP in which the duration of time spent in morphine paired<br>context relative to saline paired context was used as the<br>index of preference",
          "To date the general procedure described by Rossi and Reid<br>has been adopted for essentially all subsequent CPP studies<br>with some modifications",
          "Although methodological details differ among laboratories<br>typical CPP experiment includes differentially pairing two<br>distinct sets of environmental contextual cues with the<br>stimulus of interest e.g drug food copulatory opportunity",
          "The contextual cues tend to differ along several stimulus<br>dimensions",
          "For example the contexts may vary in flooring size or shape<br>wall color or pattern and olfactory cues",
          "Conditioning involves an animal receiving repeated access to<br>the appetitive stimulus termed unconditioned stimulus or US<br>in one context termed conditioned stimulus or CS",
          "Intermixed with these context US pairings is similar<br>exposure to the other context without the US.Following<br>conditioning is choice test in which animals receive<br>unrestricted exposure to both contexts in the absence of the<br>US",
          "An increase in time spent in the paired context relative to<br>control value is taken as evidence that the US was rewarding",
          "Presumably the learned association between the context CS<br>and the US results in animals spending more time in that<br>context",
          "Research has shown that wide array of stimuli can condition<br>an increase in preference",
          "For example access to natural appetitive stimuli like food<br>Spyraki water Ågmo sweet fluids conspecific interaction<br>wheel running Antoniadis copulation Meisel and novel stimuli<br>can condition preferences in rodents",
          "These preferences are subject to changes in motivational<br>state as food deprived rats will prefer context previously<br>paired with food whereas water deprived rats will prefer<br>context previously paired with water",
          "Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see",
          "Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process",
          "An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement",

          "The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool",
          "The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward",
          "logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward",
          "This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training",
          "Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes",

          "Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes",
          "Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine",
          "Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process",

          "In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration",
          "In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats",
          "Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated",
          "In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue",

          "Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine",
          "One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter",

          "Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory",
          "This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g",
          "For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS",
          "The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control",
          "However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g",

          "In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS",
          "Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment",
          "That is what becomes associated with the context CS",
          "Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf",

          "This is an important issue for studies with CPP that<br>typically use multimodal cues because the form of drug<br>induced CR may vary as function of the type of CS used to<br>establish conditioning",
          "While our discussion has focused on the context CS paired<br>with the drug US CXT CPP experiments are typically<br>successive discrimination task in which animals also receive<br>equal exposure to second distinct context not paired with<br>the drug US CXT",
          "Does learning occur to CXT or does it remain neutral",
          "It is likely that the organism becomes familiar with CXT",

          "Among these advantages the ability of CPP to measure drug<br>reward using single contextdrug US pairing is perhaps the<br>most unique advantage",
          "With drug self administration repeated self infusions of<br>drug are required in order to establish reliable behavior<br>and this repeated exposure protocol likely affects receptor<br>transduction mechanisms related to tolerance andor<br>sensitization",
          "In contrast single trial CPP has been demonstrated with<br>morphine Mucha cocaine and amphetamine This procedural<br>advantage allows for determining drug reward without any<br>induction of tolerance or sensitization",
          "Such information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen",
          "In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention",
          "One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward",
          "This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation",
          "Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas",
          "With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system",
          "Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure",
          "Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine",
          "Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats",
          "For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes",
          "Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP",
          "This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity",
          "Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu",
          "Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual",
          "Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice",
          "This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects",
          "One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward",
          "CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL",
          "The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest",
          "CPP allows for such rapid screening",
          "Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham",
          "Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve",
          "This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford",
          "Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward",
          "Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose",
          "That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded",
          "Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo",
          "In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context",
          "More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs",
          "Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward",
          "For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion",
          "Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion",
          "One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day",
          "It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context",
          "Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day",
          "While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking",
          "Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired",
          "When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation",
          "Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning",
          "An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context",
          "That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state",
          "While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel",
          "However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted",
          "In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning",
          "In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology",
          "Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals",
          "This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested",
          "Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses",
          "This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve",
          "Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive",
          "Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs",
          "strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference",
          "Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context",
          "This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests",
          "Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning",
          "Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains",
          "Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates",
          "One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine",
          "In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence",
          "More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether",
          "It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien",
          "Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience",
          "Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis",
          "At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior",
          "From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool",
          "However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered",
          "Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments",
          "To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration",
          "In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus accumbens shell may be more<br>critically involved in strengthening context drug<br>associations than in mediating the direct rewarding effect<br>of drugs of abuse"

prefer<br>context previously paired with water\", \"Of specific interest to the present review are the<br>conditioned place preferences displayed when drug of abuse<br>serves as the US for recent review see\", \"Since the early there has been some disagreement about<br>whether drug CPP and self administration represent two<br>alternative methods for measuring common reward process\", \"An early report by Katz and Gormezano declared that CPP was<br>rapid and inexpensive technique for measuring drug<br>reinforcement\", \"Although this report presented only limited amount of data<br>it was influential because it appeared in pharmacology<br>journal with widespread readership\", \"The few CPP studies that predated Katz and Gormezano were<br>published in primarily psychology journals e.g and those<br>psychological reports emphasized CPP more as learning<br>phenomenon rather than pharmacological tool\", \"The important inference derived from the Katz and Gormezano<br>report was that CPP and self administration are isomorphic<br>measures of single drug process namely reinforcement or<br>reward\", \"logical extension of this inference was that CPP could be<br>substituted for self administration to measure drug reward\", \"This extension is appealing because CPP requires no surgery<br>is relatively inexpensive and requires relatively little<br>training\", \"Partial support for the claim that CPP is isomorphic with<br>self administration may come when one compares the ability<br>of each experimental protocol to detect reward across<br>various drug classes\", \"On balance there appears to be reasonable concordance<br>between drugs that produce CPP and drugs that are self<br>administered\", \"see Table This concordant relationship only exists with rats<br>as insufficient CPP data are available utilizing other<br>species\", \"Nonetheless within this species various stimulants opiates<br>and other drugs are known to support both CPP and self<br>administration\", \"In contrast neither CPP nor self administration is produced<br>by host of other drug classes including antagonists for<br>dopamine opioid and cholinergic receptors as well as<br>antidepressants that work on either noradrenergic or<br>serotonergic systems\", \"Despite this parallel however there are some notable<br>exceptions to the general concordance between CPP and self<br>administration across drug classes\", \"Although limited data are available CPP may be unique in its<br>ability to detect the rewarding effect of lysergic acid<br>diethylamide LSD buspirone and pentylenetetrazole whereas<br>selfadministration may be unique in its ability to detect<br>the rewarding effect of pentobarbital and phencylclidine\", \"Table This discordance indicates that CPP and<br>selfadministration are not redundant measures of common<br>process\", \"Some caution should be exercised in interpreting this<br>discordance however as it is impossible to demonstrate that<br>drug will not produce CPP or be self administered under any<br>condition at any dose\", \"In addition to the discordance between CPP and<br>selfadministration noted across some drug types several<br>recent studies have demonstrated clear dissociation between<br>CPP and self administration\", \"In one study from our laboratory we measured both the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and rate of amphetamine self<br>administration in random sample of rats\", \"Regardless of whether self administration was measured on<br>fixed ratio FR or progressive ratio PR schedule of<br>reinforcement we found that individual differences in the<br>magnitude of amphetamine CPP and the rate of amphetamine<br>self administration were not correlated\", \"In another study Deroche allowed rats to self administer<br>cocaine for either six or sessions and then examined these<br>two groups for cocaine CPP as well as for reinstatement of<br>self administration using cocaine cue\", \"Although the session group self administered more cocaine<br>than the six session group and showed greater sensitivity to<br>cocaine ability to reinstate operant responding no group<br>differences in the dose response curve for cocaine CPP were<br>obtained\", \"These results provide cogent evidence that CPP and self<br>administration are measuring fundamentally different<br>processes\", \"There are also several concrete examples in the literature<br>which indicate that the neuropharmacological mechanisms that<br>underlie CPP and self administration are dissociable\", \"Perhaps the most notable illustration of this point comes<br>from studies examining the effects of dopamine antagonists<br>on cocaine CPP and self administra The symbol indicates<br>positive effect the symbol indicates no effect and the<br>symbol indicates an aversion Gauvin tion in rats\", \"In general studies have shown that systemic administration<br>of cocaine induces CPP that is not altered by pretreatment<br>injections of various antagonists administered either<br>systemically Spyraki or directly into the nucleus accumbens<br>Baker\", \"This outcome contrasts with self administration studies<br>demonstrating that the reinforcing effect of cocaine using<br>either FR or PR schedules is attenuated by antagonists<br>administered either systemically Ettenberg Dalton Roberts or<br>into the nucleus accumbens Phillips\", \"Although antagonists administered prior to self<br>administration session can produce non specific effects on<br>responding independent of reinforcing effects e.g the<br>increase in cocaine self administration that occurs on an FR<br>schedule following low doses of antagonists is generally<br>thought to reflect decrease in the reinforcing effect of the<br>self administered cocaine\", \"Thus dopamine receptors appear to be involved in the primary<br>reinforcing effect of cocaine but not in the rewarding<br>effect of contextual stimuli paired with cocaine\", \"One important feature of CPP is that the drug is<br>administered passively by the experimenter\", \"This feature is distinct from the self administration<br>protocol in which the history of the drug experience is<br>under the control of the animal\", \"Recent evidence indicates that the ability of drugs to<br>activate the mesolimbic dopamine system is dependent at<br>least in part on whether the drug is administered passively<br>or is under operant control by the animal\", \"In general the increase in dopaminergic activity observed<br>with self administration of stimulant drugs is attenuated in<br>yoked control animals that receive the drug passively Di<br>Ciano Hemby Stefanski\", \"In contrast compared to self administration animals yoked<br>control animals show more pronounced dopaminergic response<br>in the nucleus accumbens following exposure to stimulus<br>previously paired with the amphetamine infusion Di Ciano\", \"Given these neurochemical differences in active and passive<br>administration groups it seems that the yoked control group<br>in drug self administration experiment rather than the self<br>administration group is the more appropriate comparison to<br>CPP.In conclusion there seems to be no reasonable argument<br>remaining to support the claim that CPP and<br>selfadministration are isomorphic measures of drug reward\", \"In most CPP research investigators assume that the context<br>CS becomes associated with the drug US through Pavlovian<br>conditioning process\", \"Although the bulk of research supports this assumption what<br>is required for the acquisition of the conditioned<br>association between the context and the US\", \"For over years there has been much empirical and theoretical<br>effort spent on determining what factors are necessary for<br>acquisition and later expression of conditioned associations<br>between CSs and USs\", \"In this section of the review we will provide summary of<br>some of the current thinking and debate as it relates to<br>CPP.Early theorists argued that temporal contiguity was<br>necessary and sufficient for learning\", \"That is the CS must occur close in time with the US\", \"In most if not all CPP experiments there is good temporal<br>contiguity between the context CS and the drug US the drug<br>is often administered either immediately before or upon<br>placement in the paired context\", \"Presumed early failures in contiguity theory however lead to<br>the competing theoretical position that information or<br>predictive and non redundant relation between the CS and US<br>was required for the acquisition of conditioned association\", \"In CPP experiments there tends to be perfect predictive<br>relation between the context CS and drug administration the<br>drug US and context CS always co occur\", \"Although different variants of information theory are in use<br>in recent years the theoretical pendulum has been swinging<br>back to contiguity theory\", \"This change is driven in part by an accumulation of failures<br>of information theory and the ability of contiguity based<br>models to account for these failures e.g\", \"For example information theory suggests that the best<br>control procedure is one in which the probability of the US<br>during the CS is equal to the probability of the US in the<br>absence of the CS\", \"The CS presumably remains neutral because it does not<br>predict the presence or the absence of the US in this random<br>control\", \"However excitatory conditioning has been repeatedly reported<br>with this control procedure e.g\", \"This conditioning results from accidental contiguous<br>pairings of the CS and US early in training even though<br>there is no overall predictive relation between the CS and<br>US\", \"Indeed to avoid such situations the most popular and widely<br>accepted control group in CPP is the explicitly unpaired<br>control group\", \"In this control contiguous occurrences of the CS and drug US<br>are avoided by never allowing the drug to be administered<br>close in time to the context CS\", \"Well controlled experiments use this unpaired control in<br>combination with control groups that receive only exposure<br>to the CS andor to the drug US to assess the potential<br>influence of inhibitory conditioning see later An important<br>question that arises from the current discussion is what<br>event is temporally contiguous with the CS in CPP experiment\", \"That is what becomes associated with the context CS\", \"Perhaps the most widely accepted answer is the stimulus<br>conditions produced by the drug cf\", \"As argued earlier the CPP protocol provides measure of the<br>rewarding effect of the drug US similar to that postulated<br>by opponent process theories\", \"The rewarding effect has temporal profile that presumably<br>increases and then decreases across the time since<br>administration\", \"Consistent with this Ettenberg found that cocaine given<br>either immediately or min prior to placement into context<br>produced CPP whereas cocaine given min prior to placement<br>into context produced conditioned place aversion\", \"This latter finding indicates that the temporal effect of<br>cocaine is biphasic with an initial period of positive<br>effect followed by period of negative effect\", \"Thus the onset offset and subsequent opponent process of<br>drug elicited effects are in part function of the<br>pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug under study\", \"As further layer of empirically and theoretically<br>interesting complexity the pharmacokinetics and<br>pharmacodynamics of drug can change with repeated exposures\", \"Some behavioral protocols allow one to readily measure the<br>temporal profile of the drug effect of interest\", \"Drug discrimination is good example where the temporal<br>profile of the discriminative stimulus cueing effects of<br>various abused drugs has been investigated\", \"e.g Jones\", \"Pratt In contrast little is known about the temporal profile<br>of the rewarding effects of many abused drugs\", \"The CPP protocol seems well suited to investigate the<br>temporal profile of reward and the necessary contiguous<br>relation between this profile and the context CS for<br>acquisition of conditioned association\", \"The limited literature attempting to elucidate the temporal<br>profile of drug reward in the CPP situation has employed two<br>main techniques behavioral and pharmacological manipulations\", \"report by exemplifies the use of both techniques to<br>elucidate some of the temporal qualities of the rewarding<br>effect of acute morphine\", \"In that study rats received single IV morphine infusion in<br>one distinct context second distinct context was equally<br>experienced but was not paired with drug before the<br>preference test\", \"One behavioral manipulation involved varying the temporal<br>arrangement between the CS and US\", \"This was accomplished by infusing morphine at different time<br>intervals or min following the onset of min placement into<br>the paired context\", \"CPP was observed when morphine was infused immediately upon<br>placement in the paired context\", \"However infusion of morphine either or min after exposure to<br>the CS abolished this place conditioning effect\", \"This technique provides some control

information may be especially useful in studying the<br>antecedent conditions related to initiation of drug use<br>since clinical evidence suggests that vulnerability to drug<br>abuse may be predicted by the degree of positive reward<br>derived from the initial drug experience Haertzen\", \"In addition to the list of advantages offered by Carr there<br>at least four additional advantages of CPP that deserve<br>mention\", \"One advantage is that CPP is well suited for assessing<br>locomotor activity concomitantly with drug reward\", \"This advantage is important because an influential theory<br>proposed over decade ago is that there is common brain<br>circuitry underlying both drug reward and locomotor<br>stimulation\", \"Drug induced locomotor sensitization has also been widely<br>studied in its own right and several mechanistic<br>explanations of this phenomenon have been formulated Kalivas\", \"With CPP locomotor activity during drug conditioning trials<br>can be readily monitored by either inserting photobeams into<br>the context or by using video tracking system\", \"Acute and chronic changes in activity can then be analyzed<br>as separate dependent variable or as correlative variable<br>with the CPP measure\", \"Interestingly similar to the locomotor sensitization that<br>develops to repeated injections of stimulants and opiates<br>CPP is enhanced by repeated drug injections of amphetamine<br>cocaine or morphine\", \"Despite this parallel however work in this area has shown<br>that locomotor sensitization and development of CPP are<br>dissociable effects and thus reflect at least in part<br>separate neural mechanisms\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it is adaptable to variety<br>of laboratory animals beyond rats\", \"For example cocaine CPP has been demonstrated in chickens<br>Hughes\", \"Because chickens have highly evolved visual system sensitive<br>to color and fine detail Hughes used visual stimuli as the<br>CS to establish the CPP\", \"This contrasts with the multimodal contextual cues visual<br>tactile olfactory typically used with rats species that has<br>relatively poor visual capacity\", \"Visuallybased CPP in an avian species may offer some unique<br>advantage in modeling conditioned drug effects that are<br>obtained when visual drug associated stimuli are presented<br>to humans in controlled laboratory setting Childress Liu\", \"Such information may be important in discerning whether the<br>mechanisms of conditioning differ depending on whether the<br>contextual CS elements are distal visual or proximal tactile<br>olfactory to the individual\", \"Along with avians CPP appears to be readily adaptable to<br>mice\", \"This versatility is important because the mouse is now the<br>primary species used for genetic analyses of drug effects\", \"One illustration of this point comes from recent work<br>showing that knockout mice lacking either dopamine or<br>serotonin transporter genes show robust cocaine and<br>methylphenidate CPP Sora thus calling into question the<br>widely held assumption that these monoamine transporters are<br>critically involved in stimulant reward\", \"CPP may also be useful in genetic analyses using the method<br>of quantitative trait loci QTL\", \"The QTL method requires screening number of recombinant<br>inbred mouse strains in order to iden tify candidate genetic<br>loci for the trait of interest\", \"CPP allows for such rapid screening\", \"Indeed Cunningham and colleagues have developed what appears<br>to be sensitive and optimally controlled CPP methodology for<br>use in different mouse strains Cunningham\", \"Another advantage of CPP is that it typically yields<br>monophasic dose effect curve\", \"This pattern contrasts with self administration experiments<br>which typically yield inverted shaped dose effect curves<br>Stafford\", \"Monophasic dose effect curves are advantageous because they<br>simplify statistical analysis and allow for more definitive<br>statement about the direction of change either increase or<br>decrease in drug reward\", \"Despite this advantage it has been argued that CPP is not<br>particularly sensitive to changes in drug dose\", \"That is dose effect CPP experiments often but not always<br>yield monophasic curve that appears to be all or none rather<br>than graded\", \"Importantly previous meta analytic review of the CPP<br>literature revealed that graded monophasic dose effect<br>curves are evident with morphine heroin and amphetamine but<br>may be lacking for cocaine Bardo\", \"In addition somewhat overlooked study by Barr demonstrated<br>that the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve can be<br>sharpened by training rats with one of several different<br>drug doses in one context and single reference dose rather<br>than saline in different context\", \"More work is needed to discern the methodological conditions<br>under which the gradation in the CPP dose effect curve is<br>maximized across different drugs\", \"Finally another advantage of CPP is that it has considerable<br>utility in probing the neural circuits involved in drug<br>reward\", \"For example microinjection of amphetamine into the nucleus<br>accumbens produces CPP whereas microinjection of amphetamine<br>into the area postrema produces conditioned taste aversion\", \"Other studies have shown that microinjection of opioids into<br>the ventral tegmental area VTA produces CPP whereas<br>microinjection of opioids into the VTA nucleus accumbens<br>medial prefrontal cortex or lateral hypothalamus produces<br>conditioned place aversion\", \"One major concern regarding CPP is the potential confounding<br>influence of novelty seeking behavior on the test day\", \"It is well established that rats prefer novel context over<br>familiar context\", \"Bardo This finding leads to the possibility that pairing the<br>drug with one context retards or blocks completely<br>familiarization to that context thus rendering it more novel<br>relative to the saline context on the drug free test day\", \"While virtually all CPP experiments to date are subject to<br>this potential interpretation it should be noted that the<br>concept of reward seems to account for more of the data<br>across CPP experiments than the concept of novelty seeking\", \"Nonetheless one way to directly handle the issue of novelty<br>in any given experiment is to test animals in an apparatus<br>that has three distinct contexts one that is novel one that<br>is drugpaired and one that is saline paired\", \"When tested in this situation rats show preference for the<br>drug paired context relative to the novel context thus<br>negating any novelty interpretation\", \"Importantly the novelty interpretation of CPP is<br>fundamentally distinct from the notion of state dependent<br>learning\", \"An interpretation based on state dependency would posit that<br>the stimulus effect of the drug itself plays critical role<br>in determining the relative novelty of each context\", \"That is since familiarization occurs to one context under<br>drug influence then this context CTX would be relatively<br>more novel i.e preferred when the animal is tested in drug<br>free state\", \"While this notion seems plausible state dependent<br>interpretation would also posit that when animals are tested<br>under the influence of the drug they would prefer the saline<br>paired context CXT because it would be relatively more novel\", \"However since animals prefer the drug paired context<br>regardless of whether they are tested with or without drug<br>the notion that CPP reflects purely state dependent effect<br>can be discounted\", \"In addition in the event that given drug fails to produce<br>CPP one can readily assess the issue of state dependency by<br>administering the drug on the test day following<br>conditioning\", \"In addition to the potential novelty confound one of the<br>most serious limitations of CPP is the difficulty in<br>generating the type of dose effect information normally<br>expected in behavioral pharmacology\", \"Although graded dose effect curves may be generated under<br>some methodological conditions each point on the dose effect<br>curve requires an independent group of animals\", \"This between subject approach poses practical limitation on<br>the number of drug doses including vehicle that can be<br>reasonably tested\", \"Compounding this problem is the fact that the dose effect<br>results are not manifested until the final test day<br>following conditioning thus preventing adjustments in the<br>doses tested as the experiment progresses\", \"This contrasts with drug self administration experiments in<br>which within subject dose effect results are typically<br>obtained across repeated sessions and dose adjustments can<br>be made on session to session basis in order to characterize<br>completely the graded portions of the curve\", \"Due to this limitation CPP tends to be cumbersome for<br>answering number of critical pharmacological questions<br>requiring full dose effect curves including questions<br>related to whether given treatment alters drug potency or<br>efficacy or whether given antagonist effect is competitive<br>or non competitive\", \"Another limitation of CPP stems from the tendency of animals<br>to prefer one of the two distinct contexts of the apparatus<br>before conditioning occurs\", \"strong preference for one context creates dilemma in which<br>the experimenter must choose between two problematic avenues<br>pairing the drug with the preferred context which may<br>mitigate against showing CPP due to ceiling effect or<br>pairing the drug with the non preferred context which may<br>produce CPP by reducing the aversion to that context rather<br>than producing true preference\", \"Although reducing an aversion to context may be mechanism by<br>which drugs have rewarding effect the best approach for<br>conducting CPP experiments is to construct an apparatus that<br>minimizes any strong bias in preference for either context\", \"This can be difficult challenge especially since bias may<br>not be apparent with an initial test but may emerge across<br>repeated tests\", \"Inherent differences in preference also pose considerable<br>obstacle for genetic analyses of CPP using inbred mouse<br>strains as strains may differ in the magnitude of inherent<br>preference for one context thus confounding the<br>interpretation of shifts in preference following drug<br>conditioning\", \"Importantly Cunningham have developed an exemplar non biased<br>procedure utilizing tactile cues to assess CPP across<br>different mouse strains\", \"Finally lingering criticism of CPP is that it has not been<br>validated as protocol for measuring drug reward in either<br>humans or non human primates\", \"One published report has shown that rhesus monkeys prefer<br>context associated previously with cocaine\", \"In that report however the contextual preference differed<br>from more traditional CPP studies because the cocaine was<br>self administered rather than experimenteradministered and<br>the preference was only demonstrated when monkeys were<br>tested under drug influence\", \"More important an experimental demonstration of CPP in<br>humans is lacking altogether\", \"It is notable that clinical investigators and behavioral<br>pharmacologists have not pursued CPP in humans especially<br>since humans display wide range of conditioned drug effects<br>and these effects are thought to play prominent role in long<br>lasting compulsion and cue elicited craving Brien\", \"Perhaps most relevant to CPP humans will choose pill<br>previously associated with drug experience over pill<br>previously associated with placebo experience\", \"Drug abuse is multi faceted problem that requires an<br>understanding of basic processes underlying drug reward from<br>different levels of analysis\", \"At the behavior analytic level the ultimate goal is to<br>reduce or abolish completely drug taking behavior\", \"From this perspective drug selfadministration offers<br>critical psychopharmacological tool\", \"However environmental cues associated with the drug<br>experience also play critical role in acquiring and<br>maintaining drug taking behavior because approach to drug<br>associated context typically sets the occasion for drug<br>taking behavior to be engendered\", \"Since contextdrug associative learning is likely<br>fundamentally distinct from the acquisition of drug<br>reinforced operant response it is faulty to assume that the<br>results obtained from CPP must mirror the results obtained<br>from self administration experiments\", \"To the contrary it is our view that CPP is unique measure of<br>drug reward that is subserved by neuropharmacological<br>circuitry distinct at least in part from that which<br>subserves self administration\", \"In this regard it is important to note that the most recent<br>formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of drug reward have<br>emphasized that the nucleus
