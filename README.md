### pdf parsing

### pdfminer TODO
- merge lines of equal font size into blocks
- merge chunks of only minimally variable font size (in scanned text it's continuous!) -- it creates false chunks...
- in fontsize clustering reduce the number of clusters in case of low and long left tail
- see what can be achieved with TTextBox
