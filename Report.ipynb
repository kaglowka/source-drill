          "In the United States , for example , nearly 600,000 people<br>with ESRD must decide whether to continue life on dialysis<br>or have a deceased donor kidney transplant ( DDKT ) or<br>living donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) ( United States<br>Renal Data System , 2012 )",
          ". Compared with life on dialysis , transplant is widely<br>recognized as the optimal treatment due to its association<br>with superior patient survival and quality of life ( Neipp<br>et al . , 2006 ; Orr et al . , 2007 ; United States Renal<br>Data System , 2012 ) .",

          "With a shortage of deceased donor kidneys available for<br>transplant internationally ( United States Renal Data System<br>, 2012 ) , LDKT is also the only transplant option with the<br>potential for continued growth .",
          "For these reasons , community nephrologists , dialysis<br>professionals , and transplant staff are having<br>conversations with ESRD patients and their support networks<br>regularly about the treatment option of LDKT .",
          "The decision whether to pursue LDKT is complex .",
          "ESRD patients pursuing LDKT must complete a battery of<br>medical and psychological evaluations , weigh the risks and<br>benefits of LDKT for themselves and any donors , be ready<br>and willing to have another person in their life donate to<br>them , feel confident making efforts to find potential<br>living donors , and be willing to have surgery and adhere to<br>a postoperative care regimen .",

          "Research also has shown that many patients feel vulnerable<br>asking others to donate a kidney to them ( Rodrigue et al .<br>, 2008a ) , and find taking specific actions like having<br>discussions with one 's family or friends to be very<br>challenging ( Boulware et al . , 2012 ; Waterman et al . ,<br>2006 ) .",

          "This study is the first to demonstrate that the TTM<br>theoretical foundation and key TTM constructs are well<br>suited to assess the decision -making of kidney patients<br>considering whether to pursue LDKT.Successful receipt of<br>LDKT requires the involvement of another person -a matching<br>living donor .",
          "One important question raised by this study is whether<br>patient decision -making related to this type of behavior<br>could be guided by the constructs of the TTM .",
          "We found that the staging assessment for pursuit of LDKT is<br>consistent with staging assessments for many other complex<br>behaviors .",
          "The measure development process led to a clear and ordered<br>assessment of LDKT SOC , where patients in Action for LDKT<br>readiness reported taking specific actions like asking a<br>potential living donor to be evaluated .",
          "These actions may or may not result in finding a matching<br>living donor , thus patients can shift in their LDKT<br>readiness over time .",
          "In both Samples 1 and 2 , despite slight variation in<br>question wording and order differences , there was<br>remarkable similarity between the percentage of patients in<br>each SOC across ESRD patients , suggesting the readiness<br>construct meaningfully applies to LDKT decision -making and<br>is robust enough to withstand variation in measurement .",
          "The validated SOC measure asks how ready a patient is to<br>take LDKT actions generally , and then provides additional<br>clarity on the specific LDKT actions an individual patient<br>is willing to take .",
          "Some behaviors , like generally talking to people about one<br>'s interest in transplant , sharing educational materials<br>about living donation with people in one 's life , and<br>allowing others to share their need for a living donor<br>kidney , are generally more common for all patients to be<br>ready to take .",
          "However , three LDKT actions , accepting someone 's offer to<br>donate a kidney , sharing their need for a living donor with<br>a large community through a general announcement , and<br>asking a potential donor to be tested , are significantly<br>more likely to be taken when a patient is in Action ,<br>compared to patients in pre -Action stages .",
          "Thus , when tailoring discussion and educational feedback<br>for patients in early stages of readiness , recommendations<br>to take more common LDKT actions like generally talking to<br>people about their interest in living donation and sharing<br>educational materials about LDKT with people in their life<br>may be more ideal .",
          "However , patients in Action will more likely benefit from<br>additional discussion and practical assistance with doing<br>behaviors like getting the word out about their need for a<br>living donor to large groups of individuals , asking<br>potential donors directly to be evaluated , and accepting<br>someone 's offer to donate .",
          "Future research must continue to learn more about the<br>different patterns of LDKT actions and how they relate to<br>pursuit and successful receipt of LDKT.In addition , brief ,<br>internally consistent measures of DB and SE for pursuit of<br>LDKT were developed .",
          "Using data from Sample 1 , evaluations of the DB Pros , Cons<br>, and SE scales by stage were largely consistent with<br>previous TTM research in DDKT ( Waterman et al . , 2010a )<br>and in other health behavior applications ( Hall and Rossi ,<br>2008 ) .",
          "Study 2 results found that increases in Pros of LDKT from<br>Precontemplation ( 0.92 SD found ; 1 SD expected ) and<br>decreases in Cons of LDKT from Precontemplation ( 0.29 SD<br>found ; 0.5 SD expected ) were consistent with patterns<br>shown in other meta -analytic work with many other behaviors<br>( Hall and Rossi , 2004 ; Prochaska et al . , 1994 ) .",
          "Although they build upon the DB measure developed for<br>pursuit of DDKT ( Waterman et al . , 2010a ) , the Pros and<br>Cons of LDKT pursuit focus more on the elements ( i.e .<br>interpersonal challenges ) that are specific to the living<br>donor process .",
          "After an assessment of DB , a discussion with ESRD patients<br>that emphasizes the LDKT Pros and de -emphasizes the Cons<br>may help them become more ready to pursue LDKT.As predicted<br>, the SE measure developed in this study emerged as a single<br>, brief internally consistent scale assessing situational SE<br>or confidence to pursue LDKT in a variety of difficult<br>situations .",
          "In their 2001 meta -analysis examining SE in 25 studies<br>across 10 health behaviors , Rossi and Redding ( 2001 )<br>found that SE increased significantly in a linear or<br>curvilinear fashion across stages of change for the majority<br>of these studies .",
          "Across both samples presented here , scores on the SE<br>measure increased approximately 0.80 SD from<br>Precontemplation to Action .",
          "The items in the scale most reflect the challenges that<br>patients will likely face if they actively pursue LDKT with<br>particular emphasis on reaching out to potential donors .",
          "This study had several limitations .",
          "First , although our SOC measure regards patients ' overall<br>pursuit of LDKT , this behavior can be divided into three<br>separate behaviors : acceptance of any kidney transplant (<br>regardless of the organ source ) , getting evaluated for<br>transplant , and taking actions to find a living donor .",
          "Future research should examine how well our measure<br>adequately represents these separate behaviors .",
          "Second , our samples were both crosssectional .",
          "Although previous longitudinal studies investigating the<br>behavior of TTM constructs have supported the findings of<br>other cross -sectional studies ( Prochaska , 1994 ) , future<br>longitudinal studies should be conducted to examine the<br>measures developed here .",
          "Third , our primarily White and Black ESRD patient samples<br>were recruited from a single transplant center and a few<br>dialysis centers in the midwestern United States and may not<br>represent the attitudes and dispositions of ESRD patients<br>nationally .",
          "Further validation of these measures with a nationally<br>representative sample of ESRD patients , particularly<br>Hispanics/Latinos , is an important next step .",
          "Invariance testing of these measures across important<br>demographic subgroups ( e.g . Black versus White ) groups<br>should also occur .",
          "Finally , while our research strongly supports the<br>application of the TTM constructs to pursuit of LDKT ,<br>future research on ESRD patients ' and their support<br>networks ' views and attitudes on LDKT may yield other<br>relevant dimensions for study as well as introduce new items<br>that may improve the LDKT Pros , Cons , and SE measures .",
          "Further research may also lead to refinements of the<br>assessment of LDKT action steps .",
          "To treat the growing number of ESRD patients optimally , we<br>must increase the rates of LDKT nationally .",
          "Valid TTM -based measures that let us accurately assess<br>patients ' initial LDKT readiness , DB , and SE and track<br>shifts in decision -making as their kidney function worsens<br>may help clinicians have more effective conversations with<br>patients .",
          "Building upon the DDKT decision -making measures previously<br>developed by this team ( Waterman et al . , 2010a ) , after<br>this study , a complete set of theoretically consistent<br>transplant decision -making measures have now been validated<br>.",
          "These LDKT patient decision -making measures can be<br>incorporated into LDKT interventions to better honor the<br>needs of individual kidney patients and assess the<br>effectiveness of these interventions .",

          "Over the past decade , the incidence and prevalence of end<br>-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , a condition where a patient<br>loses his or her kidney function , has continued to increase<br>in almost every country in the world ( United States Renal<br>Data System , 2012 ) .",
          "In the United States , for example , nearly 600,000 people<br>with ESRD must decide whether to continue life on dialysis<br>or have a deceased donor kidney transplant ( DDKT ) or<br>living donor kidney transplant ( LDKT ) ( United States<br>Renal Data System , 2012 )",
          ". Compared with life on dialysis , transplant is widely<br>recognized as the optimal treatment due to its association<br>with superior patient survival and quality of life ( Neipp<br>et al . , 2006 ; Orr et al . , 2007 ; United States Renal<br>Data System , 2012 ) .",
          "Patients who are able to receive a LDKT from a family member<br>or friend have the best treatment outcomes , living 46<br>percent longer than if they remained on dialysis and 8<br>percent longer than if they got a DDKT ( United States Renal<br>Data System , 2012 ) .",
          "With a shortage of deceased donor kidneys available for<br>transplant internationally ( United States Renal Data System<br>, 2012 ) , LDKT is also the only transplant option with the<br>potential for continued growth .",
          "For these reasons , community nephrologists , dialysis<br>professionals , and transplant staff are having<br>conversations with ESRD patients and their support networks<br>regularly about the treatment option of LDKT .",
          "The decision whether to pursue LDKT is complex .",
          "ESRD patients pursuing LDKT must complete a battery of<br>medical and psychological evaluations , weigh the risks and<br>benefits of LDKT for themselves and any donors , be ready<br>and willing to have another person in their life donate to<br>them , feel confident making efforts to find potential<br>living donors , and be willing to have surgery and adhere to<br>a postoperative care regimen .",
          "In addition to concerns and questions that patients have<br>about undergoing transplant surgery themselves ( Kurz et al<br>. , 2007 ; Waterman and Brennan , 2007 ; Waterman et al . ,<br>2006 ) , accepting a kidney from a living donor , especially<br>from a child of the patient , can be very difficult (<br>Waterman et al . , 2006 ) .",
          "Research also has shown that many patients feel vulnerable<br>asking others to donate a kidney to them ( Rodrigue et al .<br>, 2008a ) , and find taking specific actions like having<br>discussions with one 's family or friends to be very<br>challenging ( Boulware et al . , 2012 ; Waterman et al . ,<br>2006 ) .",
          "Finally , patients also have high levels of concern about<br>living donors losing their remaining kidney function ,<br>financial costs incurred by donors , and donors '<br>disappointment if the transplant fails ( Waterman et al . ,<br>2006 ) .",
          "Challenges to successful pursuit of LDKT also may be<br>heightened for ethnic/racial minority patients .",

          "The validated SOC measure asks how ready a patient is to<br>take LDKT actions generally , and then provides additional<br>clarity on the specific LDKT actions an individual patient<br>is willing to take .",
          "Some behaviors , like generally talking to people about one<br>'s interest in transplant , sharing educational materials<br>about living donation with people in one 's life , and<br>allowing others to share their need for a living donor<br>kidney , are generally more common for all patients to be<br>ready to take .",

          "Finally , while our research strongly supports the<br>application of the TTM constructs to pursuit of LDKT ,<br>future research on ESRD patients ' and their support<br>networks ' views and attitudes on LDKT may yield other<br>relevant dimensions for study as well as introduce new items<br>that may improve the LDKT Pros , Cons , and SE measures .",
          "Further research may also lead to refinements of the<br>assessment of LDKT action steps .",
          "To treat the growing number of ESRD patients optimally , we<br>must increase the rates of LDKT nationally .",
          "Valid TTM -based measures that let us accurately assess<br>patients ' initial LDKT readiness , DB , and SE and track<br>shifts in decision -making as their kidney function worsens<br>may help clinicians have more effective conversations with<br>patients .",
          "Building upon the DDKT decision -making measures previously<br>developed by this team ( Waterman et al . , 2010a ) , after<br>this study , a complete set of theoretically consistent<br>transplant decision -making measures have now been validated<br>.",

          "The purpose of the present review is to provide an<br>integrated understanding of how sleep health ( Buysse 2014 )<br>affects one salient biological mechanism , the immune system<br>, with implications for infectious and inflammatory disease<br>risk .",
          "This review considers ( a ) the restorative role of sleep on<br>the immune system ; ( b ) the influence of sleep disturbance<br>on adaptive and innate immunity ; and ( c ) the role of<br>sleep disturbance in risk of infectious disease and three<br>inflammation -related disorders : cardiovascular disease ,<br>cancer , and major depression .",
          "Furthermore , behavioral regulation of the immune system is<br>embedded in a conceptual model in which inflammatory<br>cytokines also have a reciprocal influence on sleep .",
          "Sleep is first and foremost a behavior , which is<br>characterized by changes in body posture and eye state ; it<br>is dimensionally evaluated by self -report , behavioral ,<br>physiological , circuit , cellular , and genetic levels of<br>analysis ( Buysse 2014 ) .",
          "Whereas such analyses can be used to differentiate arousal<br>states along a continuum from fully awake to deep sleep , it<br>is widely recognized that the electroencephalogram ( EEG )<br>or polysomnography is the gold standard for the objective<br>assessment of sleep .",
          "Polysomnography records sleep continuity , sleep<br>architecture , and rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep .",
          "Sleep continuity measures include the duration of sleep (<br>i.e . , total sleep time ) , the length of time from turning<br>off the lights until sleep onset ( i.e . , sleep onset<br>latency ) , and the degree to which sleep is maintained<br>continuously throughout the night ( i.e . , sleep efficiency<br>or the ratio of wake time to time in bed ; awake time after<br>sleep onset ) .",
          "Sleep architecture measures categorically divide sleep into<br>two major phases , non -rapid eye movement ( NREM ) and REM<br>sleep , with further subdivision of NREM sleep into stages 1<br>, 2 , 3 , and 4 , although recent research has combined<br>stages 3 and 4 into slow -wave sleep ( SWS ) because of the<br>inherent difficulties in distinguishing these latter two<br>stages of deep sleep .",
          "Stage 1 is the transition between wakefulness and sleep ,<br>whereas sleep onset is generally defined to occur when<br>spindles and K -complexes characteristically appear during<br>stage 2 .",
          "SWS is identified by a preponderance of high -amplitude ,<br>low -frequency components as measured by EEG .",

          "In addition to the evaluation of sleep by polysomnography ,<br>actigraphy , and sleep diaries , the patient 's own sleep<br>perceptions play a critical role in the assessment of sleep<br>disturbance and diagnosis of insomnia .",
          "Indeed , in a study of insomniacs and controls ,<br>polysomnography testing provided little information to<br>confirm or exclude insomnia , and a large multicenter field<br>trial resulted in similar findings ( for a review , see<br>Vgontzas et al . 2013 ) .",

          "Importantly , insomnia is common in other disorders such as<br>depression , and DSM -5 classification acknowledges this<br>comorbidity without assigning casual attributions inherent<br>in primary and secondary labels .",
          "In recognition that insomnia symptoms are often prodromal to<br>the development of insomnia disorder , there has been much<br>interest in brief and valid self -report instruments to<br>screen for insomnia complaints and assess symptom severity .",
          "One example is the Insomnia Severity Index , which assesses<br>sleep quality , fatigue , psychological symptoms , and<br>quality of life , with a high sensitivity and specificity<br>for the detection of insomnia cases ( Morin et al . 2011 ) .",

          "Despite the validity and reliability of these simple<br>questionnaires , assessment of sleep disturbance in many<br>large -scale epidemiologic or naturalistic field studies is<br>limited to evaluation of one or more questions about<br>complaints , sleep quality , or sleep duration .",
          "Adaptive immunity leads to the differentiation and<br>proliferation of microbial -specific white blood cells ( i.e<br>. , lymphocytes ) that serve to eliminate microbes based on<br>an immunological memory of having responded to a specific<br>pathogen or antigen in the past .",
          "As such , the adaptive immune system coordinates a specific<br>response to an infectious challenge by a sequence of<br>coordinated steps ( Murphy 2011 ) .",
          "In response to an infectious challenge , antigen -presenting<br>cells ( APCs ) such as macrophages or dendritic cells are<br>attracted to a site of intrusion , take up invading antigen<br>, and then migrate to local lymph nodes .",
          "Within the lymph node , the APCs present antigen to T helper<br>( Th ) cells followed by release of proinflammatory<br>cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) -6 from the APCs .",
          "In response to these inflammatory signals , Th cells<br>activate , proliferate , and differentiate into one of two<br>predominant cell types , which serve to help B cells become<br>antibody -producing cells ( i.e . , plasma cells ) or leave<br>the lymph node to coordinate cytotoxic cell responses that ,<br>if successful , eliminate the pathogen .",
          "Once complete , a fraction of these antigen -specific Th<br>cells as well as cytotoxic T cells and B cells survive to<br>provide an immunological memory that achieves a more rapid<br>response when that specific infectious challenge occurs<br>again .",
          "This multicellular response is tightly regulated by both<br>costimulatory signals ( e.g . , proinflammatory cytokines<br>such as IL -6 ) and inhibitory signals ( e.g . , anti<br>-inflammatory cytokines such as IL -10 ) .",
          "Additionally , if exposure involves an intracellular<br>pathogen such as a virus , then transcription factors such<br>as interferon ( IFN ) regulatory factors are activated .",
          "These transcription factors induce antiviral immune response<br>genes such as type I IFN genes , which through the<br>translation of IFN can activate signal transducer and<br>activator of transcription ( STAT ) -1 , leading to the<br>production of proinflammatory cytokines .",
          "A failure of these regulatory mechanisms can lead to an<br>inadequate immune response ( e.g . , immune deficiency ) or<br>a response that is too robust and results in damage to the<br>host ( e.g . , autoimmunity , septic shock ) .",
          "IL -1 , IL -6 , and tumor necrosis factor -α ( TNF -α )<br>promote the differentiation of lymphocytes into cytotoxic T<br>cells , which kill pathogens that are introduced into the<br>body during physical wounding .",
          "Inflammatory cytokines promote vascular permeability and<br>cellular adhesion , which makes it possible for immune cells<br>to leave the blood vessels and migrate to tissues where they<br>can eliminate pathogens .",
          "For example , IL -1 activates the endothelial adhesion<br>molecule intercellular adhesion molecule -1 that facilitates<br>adherence of immune cells to the endothelium and migration<br>into tissues .",
          "Innate immunity is evolutionally older than adaptive<br>immunity and serves as the body 's first line of defense<br>against tissue damage and microbial infection ( Medzhitov<br>2008 ) .",
          "Composed of immune cells such as monocytes , macrophages ,<br>and dendritic cells that constantly circulate in the body ,<br>the innate immune system uses invariant receptors to detect<br>a wide variety of pathogens .",
          "Activation of these cells leads to a rapid ( i.e . , minutes<br>to hours ) cascade of inflammatory processes that help<br>contain an infection and ultimately promote healing and<br>recovery ( Medzhitov 2008 ) .",
          "When receptors of innate immune cells recognize hard -wired<br>and highly conserved features of microbes or pathogen<br>-associated molecular patterns , the acute -phase response<br>is triggered , which leads to an increase in inflammatory<br>activity that can occur both locally ( i.e . , at the site<br>of tissue injury or infection ) and systemically .",
          "This recognition strategy , which uses a relatively small<br>number of immune cell types to detect and generate a<br>response to a wide range of microbial diversity , is termed<br>pattern recognition , and innate immune receptors that use<br>this strategy are called pattern recognition receptors (<br>Medzhitov 2008 ) .",
          "Among pattern recognition receptors , Toll -like receptors (<br>TLRs ) are found on macrophages , neutrophils , and<br>dendritic cells that drive inflammation ( Medzhitov 2008 ) .",
          "Whereas TLRs recognize conserved components of microbes<br>including bacteria , viruses , and fungi , there is some<br>specificity of ligand recognition within this family of TLRs<br>.",
          "For example , lipopolysaccharide , an endotoxin that is the<br>major component of the outer membrane of Gram -negative<br>bacteria , binds to TLR4 ( Medzhitov 2008 ) .",
          "Following binding of one of the TLR4 , a conserved signaling<br>cascade is initiated that is characterized by activation of<br>key intracellular transcription factors such as nuclear<br>factor -κ B ( NF -κ B ) and activator protein 1 ( AP -1 ) (<br>Karin 2006 )",
          ". Activation of NF -κ B , for example , leads to the<br>transcription of proinflammatory immune response genes such<br>as TNF -α and IL -1 and the translation and production of<br>proinflammatory cytokines that serve to coordinate the<br>inflammatory response ( Karin 2006 ) .",
          "Hence , intracellular processes that occur at the level of<br>the genome most proximally regulate the inflammatory<br>response .",
          "Sleep influences the two primary effector systems , the<br>hypothalamus -pituitary -adrenal ( HPA ) axis and the<br>sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) , which in turn regulate<br>adaptive and innate immune responses .",
          "During sleep , blood levels of cortisol , epinephrine , and<br>norepinephrine drop ( Besedovsky et al . 2012 ) , whereas<br>mediators that subserve cell growth such as growth hormone ,<br>prolactin , and the pineal hormone melatonin show a steep<br>increase in their blood levels .",
          "( For characterization of these latter neuroendocrine<br>responses , which is beyond the scope of this review , see<br>Besedovsky et al . 2012 . )",
          "In contrast , chronic sleep disturbance leads to activation<br>of the HPA and SNS pathways ( Vgontzas et al . 2013 ) ,<br>which together contribute to an increased proinflammatory<br>and reduced antiviral skewing of the basal gene expression<br>profile , termed the basal transcriptome .",
          "Such a conserved transcriptional response to adversity , of<br>which sleep disturbance is one type , has been extensively<br>discussed in prior reviews",
          "( Irwin & Cole 2011 , Slavich & Irwin 2014 .",
          "Briefly , activation of the HPA axis releases cortisol that<br>suppresses proinflammatory and antiviral immune responses by<br>three mechanisms .",
          "First , glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor<br>of gene promoter sequences and interrupt transcription of<br>proinflammatory and antiviral genes .",
          "Second , activation of the glucocorticoid receptor induces<br>transcription of certain anti -inflammatory genes , which<br>serves to interfere with activation of the transcription<br>factor NF -κ B and leads to a blockade of the inflammatory<br>cascade .",
          "Finally , protein -protein interactions interfere with<br>proinflammatory transcription factors such as NF -κ B and AP<br>-1 and antagonize inflammatory gene transcription ( Irwin &<br>Cole 2011 ) .",
          "The second effector pathway is the SNS .",
          "In contrast to HPA activation , the SNS \" steers \" immune<br>responses between antiviral and proinflammatory immune<br>responses ( Irwin & Cole 2011 ) .",
          "Immune response gene transcription is regulated via<br>stimulation of β -adrenergic receptors by the release of<br>neurotransmitter norepinephrine into peripheral tissues ,<br>primary and secondary lymphoid organs , and all other major<br>organ systems ( including the vasculature and perivascular<br>tissues )",
